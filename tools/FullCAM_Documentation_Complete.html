<h3>Overview of FullCAM</h3>
<p>An overview of what FullCAM can do.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>FullCAM is a model for tracking the greenhouse gas emissions and changes in stocks of carbon and nitrogen associated with land use and management. FullCAM is a fully integrated Carbon Accounting Model (CAM) for estimating and predicting all biomass, litter and soil carbon pools in forest and agricultural systems. In addition, it accounts for changes in major greenhouse gases, nitrogen cycling and human-induced land use practices.</p>
<p>FullCAM is the model used to construct Australia's national greenhouse gas emissions account for the land sector. Users of the model can determine project-based results on a similar basis to Australia's official recording of greenhouse emissions trends for land use and land use change.</p>
<p>FullCAM was developed to integrate data on land cover change, land use and management, climate, plant productivity, and soil carbon over time to provide a dynamic account of the changing stock of carbon in Australia's land systems since 1970.</p>
<p>FullCAM incorporates a suite of verifiable component models, adapted for use at a fine spatial (25 m) and temporal (monthly) resolution for the Australian continent, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/77_CAMFor.htm" target="_blank">CAMFor</a> – for forest systems </li>
<li><a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/78_CAMAg.htm" target="_blank">CAMAg</a> – for cropping and grazing systems </li>
<li><a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/114_RothC.htm" target="_blank">RothC</a> – for agricultural soil carbon </li>
</ul>
<p>FullCAM can run each of these sub-models in isolation or in combination. See <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/198_Constituent Models In FullCAM.htm" target="_blank">Constituent Models In FullCAM</a>.</p>
<p>The sub-models used within FullCAM can be integrated into various combinations to suit the data available and outputs required. It may be used for tracking of carbon and nitrogen stocks and flows in different forest and agricultural systems, and can also be used more simply to review project-based results for small land holdings.</p>
<p>Specifically, FullCAM calculates the carbon and nitrogen flows associated with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forests, including the wood products made from wood harvested from the forest. It calculates the carbon in the trees, debris, mulch, soils, and wood products, and the carbon and nitrogen exchanged with the atmosphere, due to thinnings, multiple rotations, and fires.</li>
<li>Agricultural systems, which can be cropped or grazed systems. FullCAM calculates the carbon and nitrogen in the plants, debris, mulch, soil, and products, and the carbon and nitrogen exchanged with the atmosphere, while including the effects of harvest, ploughing, fire, herbicides, and grazing.</li>
<li>Afforestation and reforestation systems, which are represented and modelled as transitions from agricultural systems to forests.</li>
<li>Deforestation systems, which are represented and modelled as transitions from forests to agricultural systems.</li>
<li>Mixed systems (such as in agroforestry) – assorted combinations of the systems above.</li>
</ul>
<p>FullCAM calculates the carbon and nitrogen stocks and flows (including the effect of nitrogen shortages on plant growth) for land subject to different land use and management activities.</p>
<p>FullCAM also has the ability to calculate the fossil fuel displacement values by use of wood or agricultural products (including bioenergy). For instance, if forests or crops are used for bioenergy (energy derived from burning them or their residues), FullCAM can calculate how much fossil fuel based energy emissions this would equal (given 1 tonne of biomass burned approximates to x kilojoules of fossil fuel emissions). This gives users a better understanding of the relative impacts of their land use practices on greenhouse emission levels.</p>
<p>FullCAM can also be used to review project-based results for small land holdings.</p>
<h3>Main Function</h3>
<p>The main function of FullCAM is to model the stocks and flows of carbon and nitrogen in mixed forest and agricultural systems. This includes tracking carbon and nitrogen within pure agricultural and forestry systems, as well as within transitions from an agricultural activity to a forestry activity or agroforestry system (and vice versa), and taking into account how these systems and their proportional contributions change over time. FullCAM models all carbon and nitrogen pools, plus interchanges and fluxes within the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plants</li>
<li>Debris</li>
<li>Soil</li>
<li>Products</li>
<li>Atmosphere</li>
</ul>
<p>FullCAM tracks the movement of carbon removal from the atmosphere, through the growth of plants, all the way through to their return to the atmosphere – after potentially passing through plants, debris, soil, grazing animals or wood or agricultural products.</p>
<p>FullCAM can model carbon in up to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Six tree components</li>
<li>Five crop components</li>
<li>Twelve forest debris and ten agricultural debris components</li>
<li>Six forest soil and six agricultural soil components</li>
<li>Forest products</li>
<li>Agricultural products.</li>
</ul>
<p>FullCAM can be configured into many different models, and there are hundreds of outputs to choose from. FullCAM can model different tree and crop species, and also can account for changes in carbon due to management events such as plantings, thinning, harvest, fire, grazing, and ploughing.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Using FullCAM</h3>
<p>An introduction to the sorts of things you might do with FullCAM.</p>
<h3>Simulations</h3><b>Plot Simulations</b>
<p>A <i>plot</i> is a piece of land with uniform characteristics, such as a forest stand or a paddock. A plot can have either:</p>
<ol>
<li>No area – the plot is a <i>point</i> model, and its output masses are in tonnes per hectare.</li>
<li>A specified area – the plot has an area, so its output masses are in tonnes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Plot information is stored in a <i>plot file</i>, with extension “.plo”.</p>
<p>A <i>plot</i> simulation tracks all the carbon (and optionally, nitrogen) associated with a plot – either on the plot or in the products produced by the plot.</p>
<p>Typical use:</p>
<ol><li>Create a new plot:

<ol><li>Choose <i>New Plot</i> from the <i>Document</i> menu. A blank plot document is created, and its input window appears with tabbed pages for <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/11_About.htm" target="_blank">About</a>, <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/150_Configuration.htm" target="_blank">Configuration</a> and <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/199_Timing.htm" target="_blank">Timing</a>. The titles on the <i>Configuration</i> and <i>Timing</i> pages are the colour red, indicating that these tabs are incomplete and must be completed before the plot can be simulated.</li>
<li>As soon as you have entered the minimum required data for the <i>Configuration</i> and <i>Timing</i> pages, more tabbed pages appear on the plot input window. Exactly <b>which</b> pages appear depends on your particular configuration.</li>
<li>If your configuration includes any of the multi–layer options then the <i>Data Builder</i> page appears. You can use this to download data needed to run a simulation.</li>
<li>A list of inputs can be viewed using the ‘Models and Inputs’ function located in the ‘About your Configuration’ portion of the Configuration page. It is also possible to view flow diagrams of the configured model. This can be done using the ‘Diagrams’ function.</li></ol></li>
<li>When all the data is ready (with no red tabs visible) choose ‘Simulate’ from the FullCAM main menu and ‘Run Plot Simulation’ from the drop down menu or click on the ‘Run Plot Simulation’ button, located in the lower half of the FullCAM main menu bar.</li>
<li>When you run your first simulation, a default output window will be displayed. Specify the outputs you want to look at, and create additional output windows if needed, then rerun the simulation. </li>
<li>You can now alter any inputs and immediately rerun the simulation.</li></ol>
<p>Save your work at any time by choosing <i>Save</i> from the <i>File</i> menu, or click the floppy disk button on the toolbar underneath the menu (the red dot means the document has been changed). The resulting <code>.plo</code> file contains the plot document, which includes the input window and all the associated output windows.</p>
<p>Plot simulation is the basic unit of simulation in FullCAM – simulating estates consists of simulating many plots.</p>
<p><b>Estate Simulations</b></p>
<p>A number of plots may be aggregated into an <i>estate</i> document (stored as an “.est” file). An estate is a collection of plots, each of which has a specified area and starting date for land use. As estate files are area based, their masses are quoted in tonnes. Estate files may represent a diverse area of forest with stands (trees) of different ages, types and management systems, or similarly a diverse area of agricultural land.</p>
<p>When you create an estate document (choose <i>New Estate</i> from the <i>Document</i> menu), you create any number of plots with area, each of which has its own:</p>
<ol><li>Plot file, which contains the document describing the plot, and which may be shared by multiple estate–plots.</li>
<li>Area.</li>
<li>Start date (when the estate-plot started being used as described in its plot file). You do <b>not</b> specify the actual geographic location of a plot.</li></ol>
<p>Estate files are useful for simulating larger or heterogeneous areas of land. You can also test varying timing and management options. See <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/72_Estate Simulation.htm" target="_blank">Estate Simulation</a>.</p>
<h3>Databases</h3>
<p>FullCAM stores tabular data in database documents. This data can be downloaded into plot documents by <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/132_Data Builder.htm" target="_blank">Data Builder</a>.</p>
<h3>List of Inputs</h3>
<p>In configuring data for analysis by any model within FullCAM, users are presented with a specific list of input data needed to support each configuration. The list of required input data can be viewed using the ‘Models and Inputs’ button in the ‘About your Configuration’ section of the Configuration page (tab). Various options can be selected to display the model configuration, the variable names used by FullCAM and the values assigned to the variables. This information can also be saved in a spreadsheet or text format. This capacity allows users to find a balance between the data they have available, the sophistication of the model configuration and the type and accuracy (certainty) of the outputs required.</p>
<h3>Material Flows</h3>
<p>The main carbon flow is:</p>
<p>Atmosphere → plants → debris → mulch → soil.</p>
<p>At this level the flow is unidirectional. There are only two carbon feedback loops:</p>
<ol><li>Within the mulch, due to microbes eating and dying.</li>
<li>Within the soil, due to microbes eating and dying.</li></ol>
<p>Each of these loops is strictly confined to its layer (mulch and soil respectively).</p>
<p>The other large carbon flows are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carbon moves from the debris, mulch, soil, and products to the atmosphere due to decomposition.</li>
<li>Carbon moves directly from the root debris to the soil, bypassing the mulch. </li>
<li>In a thinning or harvest event, carbon moves from the plants and debris to the products.</li>
<li>In a fire, carbon moves from the plants, debris and mulch to the atmosphere and soil.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get your simulation working realistically, you may need to alter the FullCAM inputs that determine the flows. Work back from where the simulation appears to be giving unrealistic results to where the carbon is coming from, and so on back until realism is achieved.</p>
<p>Nitrogen is more complex, due to its mobility. Simulating nitrogen introduces the mineral nitrogen pool, which is assumed to be in contact with all the other pools. Nitrogen flows through the same pools as carbon, however several additional processes exist to consume or generate nitrogen. The required or excess nitrogen associated with any of the organic pools flow into, or out of the mineral pool. If there is insufficient nitrogen in the mineral pool for all the processes to consume the amount they wish, then <i>nitrogen rationing</i> occurs – which means that less of the processes occur (for example, slowing plant growth).</p>

        <html><head><title>Documents and Files</title>
<!--#include file="./incs/header.inc.htm"-->
<p><b>Documents and Files</b></p>
<p>This topic is about using documents and files in FullCAM.</p>
<p><b>Document Types</b></p>
<p>FullCAM has two document types:</p>
<p><b>1. Plot document</b>
<br/>Represents an area of land with uniform characteristics. Masses are in tonnes per hectare if there is no area, or in tonnes if you input an area. Saved in a file extension of “.plo”. See <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/177_Plot Simulation.htm" target="_blank">Plot Simulation</a>.</p>
<p><b>2. Estate document</b>
<br/>Represents an “estate”, which is arbitrary collection of plots each with its own area. Masses are in tonnes. Saved in a file extension of “.est”.  See <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/72_Estate Simulation.htm" target="_blank">Estate Simulation</a>.</p>
<p>The main type of document are plots — for modelling forests and agriculture regions on a single homogeneous area. Estates add areas to plots, allowing you to combine multiple plots to model an heterogeneous area — such as for modelling a series of plantation forest stands.</p>
<p><b>A Document Can Have Multiple Windows</b></p>
<p>A document may have more than one window:</p>
<ul><li>There is always one window active for entering your inputs (the <i>input window</i>).</li>
<li>You may create as many output windows as you required.</li></ul>
<p>In FullCAM, you can have multiple graphs or tables for a simulation all visible at once.</p>
<p>In addition, FullCAM can open any number of documents at once. So you might have multiple documents open, each with multiple windows open.</p>
<p>A list of all open FullCAM documents can be viewed at the bottom of the drop down menu when the document item in the main menu is selected or alternatively in the document drop down list in the toolbar of FullCAM main window. By selecting a document from either of these locations.</p>
<p>The <i>Window</i> menu on the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/217_Main Window.htm" target="_blank">Main Window</a> allows you to manage the windows individually, on a window by window basis.</p>

        <h2 class="page-title">General Features</h2>
        <html><head><title>General Features</title>
<!--#include file="./incs/header.inc.htm"-->
<p><b>General Features</b></p>
<p>Some general features that every user of FullCAM should know.</p>
<p><b>Readiness</b></p>
<p>A FullCAM document (plot, estate, spatial, database) has many inputs, even in the simpler configurations. When all the inputs have been filled with valid values, and some outputs specified, then the document is ready to simulate. You cannot simulate a plot until it is ready.</p>
<p>Parts of the document that are not ready are coloured red.</p>
<p>The status bar at the bottom of the document window says whether a document is ready. When the document is ready the 'Run Plot Simulation' item in the 'Simulate' menu and its corresponding icon on the toolbar of the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/217_Main Window.htm" target="_blank">Main Window</a> become enabled.</p>
<p>The interface will only let you enter valid values. It will immediately reject an invalid value. For some inputs, the valid range depends on other inputs — so if those other inputs change then the input can become invalid, in which case it is shown with a red background.</p>
<p><b>Fractions and Percentages</b></p>
<p>In FullCAM:</p>
<p>A <i>fraction</i> is a number in the range 0.0 to 1.0.

<br/>A <i>percentage</i> is a number in the range 0.0 to 100.0.</p>
<p>The fraction <i>f</i> corresponds to the percentage (100 * <i>f)</i>. For example, the fraction 0.25 corresponds to the percentage value of 25.</p>
<p><b>Timing</b></p>
<p>The timing of land use actions can impact carbon and nitrogen levels. FullCAM has been designed to be flexible in relation to the timing of these activities. Time is simulated as a series of equal-length steps. There can be anywhere from 1 to 8760 steps per year, so FullCAM can run a simulation on a yearly to an hourly basis. None of the other inputs depends on this time scale, so you are free to run any model over any time scale. Time scales can be changed by just re-entering the number of steps per year — so you could run a plot model with monthly time steps, change the number of steps to 52 per year, and then run it on a weekly time scale. You can instruct FullCAM to record the output data after any number of steps (every step, every twelfth step, and so on), so you can run the model with many steps per year and avoid being overwhelmed with output data.</p>
<p>Input time series are always interpolated or extrapolated appropriately to match the simulation steps. For example, if you enter annual rainfall data but run the model daily, then the daily rainfall will simply be the annual rainfall divided by 365 days. See the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/135_time-series window.htm" target="_blank">Time Series Window</a> for more information.</p>
<p>The primary unit of time in FullCAM is the year. A year in FullCAM always has 365 days, there are no leap years.</p>
<p><b>Units</b></p>
<ul><li>The unit of mass is the metric tonne abbreviated “t”, or kilogram abbreviated to “kg”. Masses are often measured in tonnes of dry mass (tdm), tonnes of carbon (tC), or tonnes of nitrogen (tN).</li>
<p></p>
<li>The unit of time is the year, abbreviated “yr”.</li>
<li>The unit of area is the hectare, abbreviated “ha”.</li>
<li>The unit of distance is the meter, abbreviated “m”.</li>
<li>The unit of measuring water is millimetres, abbreviated “mm”.</li>
<li>The unit of temperature is the degree Celsius, abbreviated “deg C”.</li></ul>
<p><b>Inputs</b></p>
<p>An<i> input</i> is a numerical input that you enter into a FullCAM document. There are two types of inputs:</p>
<ol><li><i>Single number</i> inputs - A single number, other than a data point of a time series.

<li><i>Time series</i> inputs - A time series is a single value that varies with time.</li></li></ol>
<p>The <i>regular value</i> of an input is what you type into the FullCAM document, and is what is used in a plot simulation for a plot or spatial document.</p>
<p>Double-click on any input (if a time series, on its multiplier) to get information about it. Alternatively, press F2 while the input is selected.</p>
<p><b>Compatibility with Previous Versions of FullCAM</b></p>
<p>FullCAM is under continual development; features are being added and, occasionally, removed.</p>
<p>Each version of FullCAM generally has a unique file format. Newer versions of FullCAM can open and read files that were created with the older formats allowing them to be updated to the new current format.</p>
<p><b>Windows</b></p>
<p>Quit FullCAM by choosing <i>Exit</i> from the <i>Program</i> menu of the main window (shortcut ctrl-Q), or by closing the main window by its close box.</p>
<p>All FullCAM windows can be moved, and most can be resized. Move a window by dragging it by its title bar; resize a window by dragging an edge or a corner with the mouse. All FullCAM windows remember their sizes from when you last resized them.</p>
<p><b>Menus and Commands</b></p>
<p>All the commands are either:</p>
<ul><li>In the menus (either the fixed menu in the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/217_Main Window.htm" target="_blank">Main Window</a>, or the mouse right click context menu).</li>
<li>On buttons in the toolbars of the various windows.</li></ul>
<p>All of the keyboard shortcuts are noted in the menus or in the tool tips of toolbar buttons, except for those noted in <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/15_Special Keys.htm" target="_blank">Special Keys</a>.</p>
<p>Most buttons have an shortcut key so you can activate it using the keyboard instead of clicking it with the mouse. In the button’s label, its shortcut is underlined. You can always activate the key by holding down the <i>Alt</i> key while pressing the underlined key. However if the cursor is not currently in an object that accepts keyboard input (not in a text box or drop-down list box), you can omit the <i>Alt</i> key and simply press the underlined key.</p>

<!--#include file="./incs/header.inc.htm"-->
<p><b>Special Keys</b></p>
<p>The following keys have special meanings that are not necessarily apparent from looking through the menus. You do not need to know any of these meanings to use FullCAM with a mouse and the usual keys, but these meanings can speed you up.</p>
<p><b>Enter</b> - If you are in a number entry box, FullCAM immediately processes the number.</p>
<p><b>Tab</b> — Jumps to the next data entry control (box, menu, button, and so on).</p>
<p><b>Shift-Tab</b> — Jumps to the previous data entry control (box, menu, button, and so on).</p>
<p><b>Space</b> — If a button is selected, pressing the <i>Space</i> bar presses the button.</p>
<p><b>Home, End, Page Up, Page Down</b> — Move between pages in tabbed windows (such as the document input windows), move between help topics in the <i>Help</i> window, and move between records in the table windows.</p>
<p><b>Delete</b> — Deletes selected items from lists.</p>
<p><b>F1</b> — Opens the <i>Help</i> window at the help topic for the current window. If there are several help buttons on the window, pressing F1 opens the Help at the topic for the first of the buttons — you can then move to other topics using control-N (next) and control-B (back). However, in general we recommend you press the help button with the mouse to move straight to the topic you want.</p>
<p><b>F9</b> — Simulates a plot or estate document (refer <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/1_Introduction to Using FullCAM.htm" target="_blank">Introduction to Using FullCAM</a> for further details).</p>
<p><b>F12</b> — Closes the window, automatically pressing any <i>OK</i> or <i>Done</i> button on the window.</p>
<p><b>Escape</b> — Closes the window, automatically pressing any <i>Cancel</i> button on the window. Same as if the close-window box was clicked.</p>
<p><b>Alt</b> — Shifts focus to the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/217_Main Window.htm" target="_blank">Main Window</a>, ready for a letter to choose a menu. A second<i> Alt</i> key press returns you to the previous window.</p>
<p><b>Underlines on buttons</b> — If there is a button in the current window with an underlined letter, pressing that “Alt-” and that letter on the keyboard presses that button (if there is no ambiguity due to currently being in a text box and so on, just pressing the letter on the keyboard has the same effect).</p>

<p><b>Main Window</b></p>
<p>This window is the thin window across the top of your screen with a menu and toolbar, entitled “FullCAM X.X”, where X.X is the version number of the FullCAM program.</p>
<p>The main window is open whenever FullCAM is open. It is the window called “FullCAM” in the Windows Taskbar. Individual FullCAM documents or windows do not get their own buttons on the Windows Taskbar.</p>
<p>If you close the main window then you exit FullCAM.</p>
<p>The main window contains the only fixed menus.</p>
<p>You cannot resize the main window, although you can move it.</p>

<p>This window is for entering, editing, viewing, and exporting a time series.</p>
<p>This topic is displayed when you click the <i>Window</i> help icon in any time series window; when you press the <i>Data</i> help icon you open the topic about that particular time series.</p>
<p><b>Time Series Data</b></p>
<p>In FullCAM, the data points in a year are assumed to be equally spaced throughout the year. The exact way in which they are used depends on the ‘Timing’ and ‘Amount of data’ settings, as described below.</p>
<p>FullCAM will make the best possible use of the time series data you enter, regardless of the amount of time series data and the number and frequency of simulation steps. At the beginning of a simulation, FullCAM interpolates and extrapolates the given time series into a full time series, which consists of one data point per simulation step.</p>
<p><b>Interpolation</b></p>
<p>The interpolation is linear, between the nearest two given data points.</p>
<p>If there is any missing data in a time series FullCAM interpolates the missing data values based on the average of the corresponding data values from other years. For each column, the average for each data column is calculated and used for all missing data values.</p>
<p><b>Example 1.</b> Average value interpolation.</p>
<p>If there is annual rainfall data for 1994 - 1996 and July data is missing for 1995, then the July 1995 value is calculated as the average of the July 1994 and 1996 values.</p>
<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Jan</th><th>Feb</th><th>Mar</th><th>Apr</th><th>May</th><th>Jun</th><th>Jul</th><th>Aug</th><th>Sep</th><th>Oct</th><th>Nov</th><th>Dec</th></tr>
<tr><td>1994</td><td>105.9</td><td>2.7</td><td>5.9</td><td>36.3</td><td>14.8</td><td>10.9</td><td>23.1</td><td>6.6</td><td>2.5</td><td>0.8</td><td>19.7</td><td>9.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>1995</td><td>1.6</td><td>6.1</td><td>25.4</td><td>6.0</td><td>2.6</td><td>5.7</td><td></td><td>1.9</td><td>9.2</td><td>8.2</td><td>0.8</td><td>7.6</td></tr>
<tr><td>1996</td><td>0.4</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.3</td><td>28.9</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.6</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.3</td><td>6.7</td><td>10.9</td><td>9.2</td><td>2.2</td></tr></table>
<p>The interpolated value for July 1995 is:  (23.1 + 0.1) / 2 = 11.6</p>
<p><b>Example 2.</b> Unable to interpolate data values.</p>
<p>If an entire column of values are missing then FullCAM is unable to interpolate data values -- the time series window will not be ready to simulate, and the window button will be red.</p>
<p><b><i>Timing: Start year, Years are</i></b></p>
<p>The year that the time series is to start from. ‘Start year’ and ‘Years are’ together determine the years that the data in the time series table applies to.</p>
<p><b>Example 1.</b>  Calendar time</p>
<p>If ‘Start year’ is 2006 and ‘Years are’ is ‘Calendar time’, then the time series data will be applied from 2006 onwards.</p>
<p><b>Example 2.</b>  Time since start of simulation</p>
<p>If ‘Start year’ is 2007 and ‘Years are’ is ‘Time since start of simulation’, then the time series data will be applied from <i>2007 years after the simulation start time</i>. It may be more appropriate to instead set the ‘Start Year’ to 0.</p>
<p><b>Example 3.</b>  Years since plants sprouted</p>
<p>If ‘Start year’ is 2007 and ‘Years are’ is ‘Years since plants sprouted’, then the time series data will be applied from <i>2007 years after the plant event</i>. It may be more appropriate to instead set the ‘Years are’ to 0.</p>
<p>It should be noted that if this option is selected, the time series headings are always entitled ‘Data’.  This is the case even if there are 12 Data points per year (in which case the column headings would be months- Jan, Feb, Mar etc.).  This is because the column values are always relative from the plant event.</p>
<p><b><i>Timing -- Extrapolation</i></b></p>
<p>You choose the extrapolation method (for generating data points outside the range of given data): either use the data in the nearest year of given data, or cycle the given data for all time. If you only enter one year of data, it makes no difference which extrapolation method you use.</p>
<p><b>Example 1.</b> Nearest year extrapolation method.</p>
<p>If you entered rainfall for the three years 1990 to 1992 and chose the nearest year extrapolation for a simulation that went from 1980 to 2000, then:</p>
<ul><li>In each year from 1980 to 1990 inclusive, FullCAM will use the 1990 rainfall data.</li>
<li>For 1991 FullCAM will use the 1991 data.</li>
<li>For each year from 1992 to 2000 inclusive, FullCAM will use the 1992 rainfall data.</li></ul>
<p><b>Example 2.</b> Nearest year extrapolation method.</p>
<p>If you enter rainfall data for just the one year 1990 and choose the nearest year extrapolation, then in every year of the simulation FullCAM will use the 1990 rainfall (even if the simulation is from 1950 to 1972).</p>
<p><b>Example 3</b>. Cyclic extrapolation method.</p>
<p>If you entered rainfall for the three years 1990 to 1992 and choose the cyclic extrapolation for a simulation that went from 1980 to 2000, then:</p>
<p>1980, 1983, 1986, 1989, 1992, 1995, and 1998 will use the 1992 rainfall data.

<br/>1981, 1984, 1987, 1990, 1993, 1996, and 1999 will use the 1990 rainfall data.

<br/>1982, 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, and 2000 will use the 1991 rainfall data.</p>
<p><b>Example 4.</b> Cyclic extrapolation method.</p>
<p>If you enter rainfall data for just the one year 1990 and choose the cyclic extrapolation, then in every year of the simulation FullCAM (regardless of when the simulation starts or ends) will use the 1990 rainfall.</p>
<p><b>Table</b></p>
<p>Unless the time series is a spatial input (see below), the time series data will be shown as a table of numbers.</p>
<p>Each row of the table has the data for one year. For example, if the start year is 1962 and the years are calendar years, then the first row in the table is for 1962, the next row for 1963, and so on.</p>
<p>You can cut, copy, and paste rectangular blocks of numbers from the table. When pasting more than one number from the table at the same time, you need only select the upper left cell of the rectangular block you are pasting into to paste the entire selection.</p>
<p><b>Amount of Data</b></p>
<p>Change the size of the time series data by entering values in the <i>Years of data</i> and the <i>Data points per year</i> boxes. A change will take effect when the insertion point leaves a box or the <i>Update Data Siz</i>e button is clicked.</p>
<p>If the <i>Years are</i> value is set to ‘Calendar time’ and <i>Data points per year</i> (see below) is a multiple of 12, then data points will apply to specific months. For example, if there are 12 data points for the year then the first data point is for January, the next for February, and so on. Similarly, if there are 24 data points for the year then the first two data points are for the first and second halves of January, the next two for February, and so on.</p>
<p>Change the size of the window, and thus the area available to the visible part of the table, by dragging its lower right corner with the mouse.</p>
<p><b>Multiplier</b></p>
<p>The <i>multiplier</i> simply multiplies every value in the table when FullCAM uses the value in a simulation. For example, if the multiplier is 2.0, then FullCAM will use 2.0 times the values in the table. The default value of 1.0 (i.e. no multiplier imapct).</p>
<p>As the multiplier is species specific it cannot change over time.</p>

<p>This window is for entering a single number that describes the rate of decay of a pool due to some process.</p>
<p>Enter the decay rate using any of the nine equivalent expressions (the FullCAM interface only ever shows the half life).</p>
<p><b>Definition</b></p>
<p>The <i>decay rate</i> is the number that describes how fast material leaves a pool. This window is for entering the decay rate for a decay process in FullCAM.</p>
<p><b>Example</b>. A decay rate of 10% per year means that:</p>
<ul><li>After the first year only 90% of the pool remains</li>
<li>After two years only 90% * 90% = 81% of the original pool remains</li>
<li>In the third year another 10% of the material present at the beginning of the third year is lost, so after three years only 90% * 90% * 90% = 72.9% of the original pool remains.</li></ul>
<p>The simple model above occurs in many places in FullCAM, for example when describing the turnover of plant components, the breakdown of debris, or the decomposition of product pools.</p>
<p>Although the rate of outflow can be measured more easily if there is no inflow into the pool, there can be inflows to the pool at the same time as the decay process is causing material to leave the pool. The decay rate simply measures the rate of the outflow due to the decay process.</p>
<p>The process by which material leaves the pool above is <i>exponential</i>, because the rate at which material leaves is proportional to the amount of material present. An exponential decay model is widely used in FullCAM because it is a reasonably accurate representation of a wide range of biological processes.</p>
<p><b>Equivalent Expressions</b></p>
<p>In the FullCAM interface the rate asked for is the half life. The half life is the way that FullCAM stores a decay rate and the way it uses it in the simulation calculations.</p>
<p>Some rates are not suitably expressed as the percentage lost per year. For example, 99.999% lost per year is better expressed as 61.7% lost per month, or 3.1% lost per day, or a half life of 22 days. There is no single way for specifying the rates that is suitable over the wide range that might be used in FullCAM.</p>
<p>There are nine equivalent expressions for the decay rate. Click on a radio button to enter the rate in that form. Press the <i>Tab</i> key to enter the number typed into FullCAM, and have the rate translated into the other expressions.</p>
<p><b>Graph</b></p>
<p>The graph shows the amount left in the pool as a percentage of the original amount in the pool (red), and the half life of the decay process (orange).</p>
<p><b>Decay Equation</b></p>
<p>The equation for exponential decay, shown in the graph, is that after a time <i>T</i>:</p>
<table><tr><td>The fraction lost from the pool is</td><td width="5"></td><td>1 – [(1 –<i> f</i>) ^<i>T</i>]</td></tr>
<tr><td>The fraction remaining in the pool is</td><td width="5"></td><td>(1 –<i> f</i>) ^<i>T</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>The percentage lost from the pool is</td><td width="5"></td><td>100 *  1 – [(1 – 0.01 * <i>p</i>) ^<i>T</i>]</td></tr>
<tr><td>The percentage remaining in the pool is</td><td width="5"></td><td>100 *  (1 – 0.01 * <i>p</i>) ^<i>T</i></td></tr></table>
<p>where <i>f</i> is the fraction lost per year and <i>p</i> is the percentage lost per year (<i>p</i> = 100 *<i> f</i>). Note that “^” means “to the power of”, for example 3^2 = 3 to the power of 2 = 3 squared = 9.</p>
<p><b>Limits</b></p>
<p>Because of limits in the numerical representation used in FullCAM some equivalent expressions (conversion of percentage to half life, and vica versa), will show values limited by the FullCAM display. For example, entering a half life value of 800,000 years will show a percentage remaining value of 0%, as the half life value has been converted to a percentage value so high, it cannot be displayed accurately. However the correct value is stored internally in FullCAM and is not a cause for concern for calculations.</p>
<p>The decay rate entered in this window cannot be higher than 100% lost (equivalent to a half life of 0.0 years) or lower than 0.0% lost per year (equivalent to a half life of 800,000 years).</p>
<p>Values can be entered as either percentage remaining or half life. When entering values as a percentage remaining, the display limitation will be encountered much sooner than via half life. For most uses inputting via the percentage remaining should be sufficient.</p>

<p>This window is for viewing and editing a table. See also <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/59_Find Request in a Table.htm" target="_blank">Find Request in a Table</a>.</p>
<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>The smallest lump of information that always stays together is shown in the table as a single row, and is called a <i>record</i>.</p>
<p>This window has a <i>table grid</i>, which shows the whole table, one record per line.</p>
<p>Some tables also come with a <i>detailed view</i>, which shows one record in complete detail on a panel in the right hand side of the window. If there is a detailed view, you can move the navy blue dividing line between the table grid and the detailed view by grabbing it with the mouse.</p>
<p><b>Table</b></p>
<p>The row in purple is the row that is currently being edited (and if there is a detailed view, the row shown in the detailed view). The light bands of colouring on every fifth row is to help guide your eye across large tables.</p>
<p>The table is very flexible:</p>
<ul><li>Resize the columns by moving the column dividers in the title row.</li>
<li>Change the column order by grabbing them in the title row and moving them.</li></ul>
<p>The table can be operated mainly from the keyboard:</p>
<ul><li>Press the <i>Tab</i> key to go the next cell</li>
<li>Press <i>Shift + Tab</i> to go to the previous cell.</li>
<li>Use the up and down arrow keys to move to cells above and below the current cell being edited.</li>
<li>Use the <i>Enter</i> key also moves you to the cell below.</li></ul>
<p><b>Sorting</b></p>
<p>Press the Sort button on the tool bar to sort the visible records by the leftmost table columns (sort by the leftmost column, use the next leftmost column to break ties, and so on). Change the column order by grabbing and moving them in order to get the exact sort that you want.</p>
<p>You can also sort the table by double-clicking on the title of a column. Ties in that column are resolved in the standard order for that table.</p>

        <html><head><title>Plots, Systems, Layers, and Pools</title>
<!--#include file="./incs/header.inc.htm"-->
<p><b>Plots, Systems, Layers, and Pools</b></p>
<p>An overview of the things that are modelled in FullCAM, and defines the terms used in FullCAM for those things.</p>
<p><b>Plots</b></p>
<p>A <i>plot</i> is a piece of land with uniform characteristics. There are three kinds of plot:</p>
<ol><li><i>Forest plot</i> - The plants are trees.</li>
<li><i>Agricultural plot</i> - The plants are crops.</li>
<li><i>Mixed plot</i> - A mixed plot is partly forest and partly agricultural (such as grazed woodland or agroforestry areas). The fraction of the plot that is forest (the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/206_Forest Percentage.htm" target="_blank">Forest Percentage</a>; the rest is agricultural) may vary with time. Mixed plots allow FullCAM to model transitional systems such as deforestation to an agricultural use or reforestation of pasture.</li></ol>
<p>The area of the plot is irrelevant within a FullCAM plot simulation, because all quantities are processed by the program on a per hectare basis. Masses are measured in tonnes per hectare. If you prefer to work in “tonnes” rather than “tonnes per hectare” then you can specify an area for the plot (<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/157_Site_Area.htm" target="_blank">Site : Area</a>).</p>
<p>Estate simulations work by simulating each plot in the area under consideration then multiplying the results by the area (in hectares) of the relevant plots.</p>
<p><b>Systems</b></p>
<p>A system is an independent ecosystem on a plot. There are two types of <i>system</i>:</p>
<ul><li><i>Forest (system)</i> - A forest has trees, and the characteristics associated with trees.</li>
<li><i>Agricultural system</i> - An agricultural system has crops, and the characteristics associated with crops.</li></ul>
<p>A plot consists of one or both systems:</p>
<ul><li>A forest plot consists of one system, namely a forest system.</li>
<li>An agricultural plot consists of one system, namely an agricultural system.</li>
<li>A mixed plot consists of two systems, namely a forest system and an agricultural system.</li></ul>
<p><i>Plants</i> are either trees or crops. A <i>species</i> is either a tree or crop species:</p>
<ul><li>A tree species grows in a forest</li>
<li>A crop species grows in an agricultural system.</li></ul>
<p>In a FullCAM simulation:</p>
<ul><li>Only one tree species can be growing in the forest at any one time</li>
<li>Only one crop species can be growing in the agricultural system at any one time.</li></ul>
<p>Either system may be <i>clear</i>, which means it has no plants growing in it.</p>
<p><b>Layers</b></p>
<p>A <i>layer</i> is a part of a system with similar characteristics. Each system is partitioned into six layers:</p>
<ol><li><i>Plants</i> - Either <i>trees</i> or <i>crops</i>. The plants remove carbon from the atmosphere by production (the combination of photosynthesis and respiration). Plant material moves to the debris via turnover, and to the products by thinning or harvesting. Crop material also moves to the atmosphere.</li>
<li><i>Debris</i> Dead plant material that has not reached the soil or (if the mulch is simulated) the mulch. Debris is further partitioned into:



<ol><li><i>Litter</i> — Aboveground debris. Material moves to the atmosphere and to either the mulch (if the mulch is simulated) or the active soil (if not) by breakdown.</li>
<li><i>Dead roots</i> — Belowground debris. Material moves to the atmosphere and to the active soil by breakdown.</li></ol></li>
<li><i>Mulch</i> - An optional aboveground layer between the litter and the soil, in which microbial action is modelled. Material moves to the atmosphere and within the mulch by decomposition, within the mulch by microbial death, and to the soil and atmosphere by humification.</li>
<li><i>Soil</i> - The soil is further partitioned into:

<ol><li><i>Active</i> — For material that can be moved elsewhere in the model. Material moves to the atmosphere and within the active soil by decomposition, and to the inert soil by encapsulation.</li>
<li><i>Inert</i> — For material in the soil that does not move anywhere else in the model (that is, it stays in the inert soil forever). Carbon that is encapsulated physically (usually in clay) or chemically (usually as char) may be considered inert. Fires can move carbon from all of the above layers into the inert soil.</li></ol></li>
<li><i>Minerals</i> - Mineral store for nitrogen. If there is insufficient nitrogen, the usual processes of production and decomposition moving material around may be limited.</li>
<li><i>Products</i> - Consists of plant material taken offsite such as wood or agricultural products. Material may subsequently move to the atmosphere by decomposition.</li></ol>
<p>In addition, the atmosphere is modelled as an infinite reservoir of carbon and nitrogen.</p>
<p><b>Pools</b></p>
<p>Each layer (except for the minerals) is further partitioned into several pools.  A <i>pool</i> is a collection of material that is homogeneous and not further subdivided in FullCAM. From a mechanical point of view, a FullCAM simulation consists of moving material between pools.</p>
<p>For example, in a forest the plant (tree) layer consists of the stem, branch, bark, leaf, coarse root, and fine root pools.</p>
<p>A layer is a collection of neighbouring pools with similar characteristics.</p>

        <html><head><title>Processes and Events</title>
<!--#include file="./incs/header.inc.htm"-->
<p><b>Processes and Events</b></p>
<p>This topic provides a broad overview of the more common actions that are simulated in FullCAM.</p>
<p><b>Processes</b></p>
<p>A <i>process</i> is an action that occurs continuously. The main processes included in the various layers are:</p>
<p><b><i>Plant Processes</i></b></p>
<p>Production</p>
<p>Moves carbon from the atmosphere to the plant pools. Production is the combination of photosynthesis, which moves carbon from the atmosphere to the plant pools, and respiration, which moves a lesser amount of material in the opposite direction. The net result represents plant growth.</p>
<p><i>Turnover</i></p>
<p>Moves material from a plant pool to a debris pool as the material dies.</p>
<p><i>Grazing</i></p>
<p>Moves material from the crops (via animals) to animal products, soil, and the atmosphere.</p>
<p><b><i>Debris Processes</i></b></p>
<p>Breakdown</p>
<p>Moves material from the debris to the mulch or active soil.</p>
<p><b><i>Mulch Processes</i></b></p>
<p>Decomposition</p>
<p>Moves material from the dead pools in the mulch to the atmosphere and to the live microbe pool in the mulch. This process is caused by microbial activity.</p>
<p><i>Humification</i></p>
<p>Moves material from the mulch pools to the active soil, which includes the humus pool. Caused by slaters, earthworms and so on.</p>
<p><i>Microbe death</i></p>
<p>Moves material within the mulch, from the live microbe pool to the dead microbe pools.</p>
<p><b><i>Soil Processes</i></b></p>
<p>Decomposition</p>
<p>Moves material from each of the active soil pools to the atmosphere and to the two “bio” pools and the humus pools in the active soil. Caused by soil microbes.</p>
<p><i>Conversion</i></p>
<p>Moves material from the humus pool within the active soil to the inert soil layer.</p>
<p><b><i>Products Processes</i></b></p>
<p><i>Decomposition</i></p>
<p>Moves material from each of the product pools to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Depending on the configuration of FullCAM, some or all of the above processes are simulated.</p>
<p><b>Events</b></p>
<p>An event is a particular management action that occurs. An event is instantaneous, generally causing perturbation of the biological processes involved. Events are usually human management actions.</p>
<p>FullCAM allows for the following events within each of the three plot types:</p>
<ul><li>Forest plot — Tree planting, thinning, fire, chopper roller, termites.</li>
<li>Agricultural plot — Crop planting, harvest, fire, plough, herbicide, grazing change.</li>
<li>Mixed plot — Forest fraction change (change the proportion of sunlight incident on the forest system; the remainder of the sunlight falls on the agricultural system), in addition to types for either forest or agricultural plots.</li></ul>
<p>You may specify any number of events and the times at which they occur, thereby forming an “event queue”, on the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/136_Events.htm" target="_blank">Events</a> page on the input window of a plot document. During a simulation, FullCAM simply applies the events at the times they are specified to occur.</p>

        <html><head><title>Plot Simulation</title>
<!--#include file="./incs/header.inc.htm"-->
<p><b>Plot Simulation</b></p>
<p>Some general aspects of simulating a plot in FullCAM.</p>
<p><b>Timing: Steps and Time Periods</b></p>
<p>The simulated time is partitioned into equal-length <i>steps</i>. Each step may be punctuated by one or more events, because an event may occur at any time.</p>
<p>A <i>time period</i> is the period of time from an event or step boundary to the next event or step boundary (whichever occurs first). During a time period, the only things that happen are processes (because, by definition, there are no events). Within each time period, all the processes are simulated as a single calculation that computes the effect of the processes for the whole time period.</p>
<p><b>System Separation</b></p>
<p>The forest and agricultural systems are completely separate in a FullCAM simulation, except for interaction through the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/206_Forest Percentage.htm" target="_blank">Forest Percentage</a>. The forest and agricultural systems have no effect on each other, except that the forest percentage partitions the production in the two systems.</p>
<p><b>Species Dependency</b></p>
<p>An input is <i>species-dependent</i> if it depends on the species of plant by describing a characteristic of material unique to that particular species. Species dependency extends down to and includes the debris layer, and across to the product layer, but extends no further:</p>
<ul><li>Most of the inputs for the plant, debris and product layers are species dependent.</li>
<li>None of the inputs for the mulch, soil, mineral or atmosphere layers are species dependent. Once in the mulch or soil, it is sufficient just to classify the plant material as either <i>resistant</i> or <i>decomposable</i> (and if mulch is being simulated, the resistant material as either <i>less resistant</i> or <i>more resistant</i>).</li></ul>
<p><b>Rationing of Scarce Resources</b></p>
<p>If a resource is scarce (such as available nitrogen from the mineral pool), the processes that use that resource compete for it. During each time period:</p>
<ol><li>At the beginning of the time period, we compute all the <i>non-limited moves</i> of material from pool to pool due to each process (the moves that would occur if there were no scarcity of resources).</li>
<li>The resources are rationed to each process on either a pro-rata or sequential basis (the choice is a plot input).</li>
<ul><li>Pro-rata:  Each actual move (exchange of material) is equal to the corresponding non-limited move multiplied by the <i>rationing fraction r</i>, where <i>r</i> is equal to the actual resource available divided by the sum of the amounts of the resource required by the non-limited moves.</li>
<li>Sequential:  An order of processes that affect the resource that was specified in the plot input. For each process in turn, the moves (and exchanges of scarce resources) due to the process are recomputed — and the remaining amount of scarce resource is updated after each process. Generally, early processes are allocated as much as they need and later processes (events) receive nothing.</li></ul>
<li>All the moves are applied.</li></ol>
<p>The justification for pro-rata rationing is that each process is assumed to use the scarce resource it requires at a constant rate over the time period. Therefore, if there is not enough of the resource, then  all of the processes will be limited at the same time, having each received the same fraction of its desired amount. Unless you are aware of the process order for sequential rationing, it is recommended that resources be rationed on a pro-rata basis.</p>
<p>Thus, for each time period, the processes are simulated as being continuous and simultaneous.</p>
<p>The only scarce (potentially limiting) resource included in FullCAM at this stage is available nitrogen.</p>
<p><b>Example</b>. Suppose that in a given period of time:</p>
<ul><li>Process A requires 10 tN/ha of nitrogen (N) from the mineral pool.</li>
<li>Process B requires 5 tN/ha.</li>
<li>Process C requires 1 tN/ha.</li></ul>
<p>Thus a total of 16 tN/ha of N is needed from the mineral pool. Suppose there is only 7 tN/ha of N in the mineral pool. Then, under pro-rata rationing, each process receives only 7/16 (the rationing fraction) of what it requires:</p>
<ul><li>Process A gets (7/16) * 10 tN/ha of N from the mineral pool</li>
<li>Process B gets (7/16) *  5 tN/ha</li>
<li>Process C gets (7/16) *  1 tN/ha.</li></ul>

<p>The other three menu items on the Options button allow the user to specify the nature of the information presented:</p>
<p><i>Show values</i>: presents the values entered into the various tabs and windows to the right of the descriptor of each input (e.g. Carbon % of fine roots = 38.4 %). If the value belongs to a species, it shows the value of the species that is currently selected  for editing in the appropriate tab.  If the value belongs to an event, the value shown comes from the chosen event of that type. No value is shown if there is no species or event or the value of the input is blank.</p>
<p><i>Show programming names</i>: presents the name assigned  by FullCAM programming code for the variables in square brackets (e.g. Carbon % of fine roots [CFracFirtA] = 38.4%). Programming names are useful  if you are reading and referring to the FullCAM Function Specification.</p>
<p><i>Show configuration</i>: presents the user specified configuration for the plot as the first item in the information displayed. If any discrepancies exist between this list and the regular interface, the regular interface is correct.</p>
<p>You can get help related to a specific input by placing the cursor in the line in which the input is presented and clicking the ‘Help for Input on Selected Line’ button in the menu bar (Ctrl + i). General help pertaining to this window can be obtained by clicking on the ‘Help’ button in the menu bar (F1)</p>
<p><b>Configuration Determines Inputs</b></p>
<p>The configuration you choose will affect which inputs are required. For example, if you model a forest system only, then none of the agricultural inputs will be required. Or if 3PG is not used to model tree production, the inputs that describe the net primary productivity of the forest are not required.</p>
<p>You might want to experiment with different configurations in order to determine the most configuration that most suits your needs, given the available inputs and your required outputs. To help in this process, for each configuration you can see model diagrams (<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/50_Diagrams Window.htm" target="_blank">Diagrams Window</a>) and a list of required inputs (<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/141_Models and Inputs Window.htm" target="_blank">Models and Inputs Window</a>).</p>
<p>The plot input window only shows tabs for pages that have required inputs. On these pages, any inputs that are not required are dimmed (unavailable). To see which models use which inputs, change the configuration and any other relevant settings (such as turning irrigation on or off) and see if the input is still enabled.</p>
<p><b>FullCAM Integrates Its Constituent Models</b></p>
<p>All of the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/198_Constituent Models In FullCAM.htm" target="_blank">Constituent Models In FullCAM</a> models are available, either independently or in combination. <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/77_CAMFor.htm" target="_blank">CAMFor</a> and <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/78_CAMAg.htm" target="_blank">CAMAg</a> are multilayer framework models. FullCAM allows you to run combinations of these models, to simulate single or multilayer models (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/57_Plots, Systems, Layers, and Pools.htm" target="_blank">Plots, Systems, Layers, and Pools</a>), either forest or agricultural or mixed.</p>
<p><b>Readiness</b></p>
<p>When the <i>Configuration</i> page is unready and requiring more information:</p>
<ul><li>The writing on the tab of the page is red.</li>
<li>Only the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/11_About.htm" target="_blank">About</a>, Configuration, and <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/199_Timing.htm" target="_blank">Timing</a> tabbed pages appear in the input window of the document.</li></ul>
<p>When the <i>Configuration</i> page is ready (that is, complete):</p>
<ul><li>The writing on the tab of the page is black.</li>
<li>If the <i>Timing</i> page is also ready then more than three tabbed pages appear in the input window.</li></ul>
<p>While all the input pages use the red or black tab to indicate unreadiness (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/20_General Features.htm" target="_blank">General Features</a>), only the <i>Configuration</i> page also controls which other tabbed pages appear in the document input window.</p>
<p><b>Simpler Is Usually Better</b></p>
<p>The more layers and the more sophisticated features you choose in your model, the more difficult it will be to find all the required input data. We recommend:</p>
<ul><li>Only modelling those layers and simulating those elements that you need (in particular, do not model nitrogen unless necessary)</li>
<li>Restrict model configurations to those for which data is available and for which the outputs are understandable.</li></ul>

<p><b>Plot Type</b></p>
<p>Choose the layers of the plot that you want modelled (that is, the type of plot model you want):</p>
<p><i>Trees</i></p>
<ul><li>Just the trees</li>
<li>Just the forest mulch</li>
<li>Just the forest soil</li>
<li>A multilayer forest system</li></ul>
<p>Used to model forest systems moving from plantation to plantation (rotations), from native forest to plantation, or from plantation to native forest or environmental plantings. It should <b>not</b> be used to model transitions from agricultural systems to plantations or other forest-agricultural transitions (use the mixed multilayer system instead).</p>
<p><i>Agriculture</i></p>
<ul><li>Just the agricultural mulch</li>
<li>Just the agricultural soil</li>
<li>A multilayer agricultural system</li></ul>
<p>Used to model agricultural systems. Does not include forestry activities or trees.</p>
<p><i>Mixed System</i></p>
<ul><li>A mixed multilayer system</li></ul>
<p>Consists of a multilayer forest system and a multilayer agricultural system. The relative mix of forest to agricultural system may vary with time. Used to model woodland grazing and transitions between forest and pasture (deforestation and reforestation). A multilayer model consists of multiple layers — plants (trees or crop), debris, mulch (optional), soil (optional), minerals (optional), and products.</p>
<p>Modelling only a single layer of a system causes the relevant constituent model of FullCAM to run by itself, in its original form and giving the same simulation as the standalone version of that model:</p>
<table><tr><th>Plot Type</th><th>Model Used</th></tr>

<li>The “soil-style sensitivity of debris breakdown to temperature and water” is on in any tree or crop species. (Soil-style sensitivity is automatically turned off if the soil is not included.)</li>
<li>The “mulch-style sensitivity of debris breakdown to temperature and water” is on in any tree or crop species and conditional irrigation is on. Mulch-style sensitivity requires water, but conditional irrigation is automatically turned off if the soil is not included.</li>
<li>The “mulch-style sensitivity of debris breakdown to temperature and water” is off in every species, the definite and conditional irrigation is specified by events rather than time series, and there are irrigation events. (The effects are limited to small second order effects because they are only due to graininess — see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/5_Simulation Steps.htm" target="_blank">Simulation Steps</a>) — omitting the soil omits the need to compute water, so the irrigation events are omitted, so there is a minor graininess effect on the whole simulation due to cutting some simulation steps into two parts with the irrigation events.)</li>
<p><i>Debris</i> is the largely intact dead plant material that is not part of the soil and that has not broken down to become mulch. </p>
<ol><li>Material flows from plants to the debris.</li>
<li>Material flows from the debris to the soil.</li></ol>
<li>Debris “breaks down”. This breakdown is not nitrogen limited.</li>
<p>Note that if you choose the breakdown fractions of the debris as high as possible (so all the material entering the debris layer almost immediately leaves for the mulch or soil), you effectively make the FullCAM debris layer vanish (because it has no effect).</p>

<p><b>Economic Modelling</b></p>
<p>Costs and incomes are added to various events, so that economic calculations can be performed. All economic modelling is in constant dollars.</p>
<p>If economic modelling is on then the site must have an area (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/157_Site_Area.htm" target="_blank">Site : Area</a>), so that the per-hectare costs can be added to the fixed costs and be presented as a single cost.</p>
<p>If economic modelling is on then thins and harvests must be specified by log and crop grades, because only log and crop grades include pricing information on logs and crops. Note that, even using log grades, a thin event can specify a 0% log grade and still specify which material moves to debris - so forest management activities like pruning can still be achieved with economic modelling on (same for crops).</p>

<p>Specify certain inputs as either by time series or by events.</p>
<p>Press the ‘Events’ or ‘Time Series’ button to access the window where you decide where various sorts of inputs are treated as event or as time series data.</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>FullCAM only allows events if a multilayer plot is modelled (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/6_Configure the Plot.htm" target="_blank">Configure the Plot</a>), so if modelling a plot that is not multilayer then time series data will always be used.</p>
<p>You can change these settings at any time without losing any of the time series or event data you may have entered.</p>
<p>If you do not want any of a particular input (for example, there is no irrigation in your simulation), it is easiest to set its input type to <i>Events</i>, but do not create any events of that type. This way you will not be asked for the time series input.</p>
<p>Some inputs, such as irrigation, can be specified either as events or as time series. This is where you configure how they are to be specified.</p>
<p>Unless a forest, agricultural or mixed system are modelled then FullCAM does no allow events and thus time series data will always be used.</p>
<p><b>Irrigation</b></p>

        <html><head><title>Forest Percentage</title>
<!--#include file="./incs/header.inc.htm"-->
<p><b>Forest Percentage</b></p>
<p>The forest percentage specifies proportional allocations for a number of parameters in forest and agricultural systems within a mixed plot (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/57_Plots, Systems, Layers, and Pools.htm" target="_blank">Plots, Systems, Layers, and Pools</a> and <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/6_Configure the Plot.htm" target="_blank">Configure the Plot</a>).</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The concept of the “forest percentage” arises only in a mixed multilayer plot. A mixed multilayer plot has a multilayer forest system and a multilayer agricultural system. In such a system, the forest percentage scales most initial conditions and agricultural behaviour in accordance with this percentage.  For example, if the forest percentage in 30%, then the agricultural percentage is 70%.</p>
<p><b>Definition</b></p>
<p>The <i>forest percentage</i> is defined as the percentage of the plot covered by the tree canopy.</p>
<p>For example, a plot with 10 ha of forest and 30 ha of agricultural system has a forest percentage of 25% (because 10 / 40 = 25% of the plot is forest).</p>
<p><b>Discussion</b></p>
<p>The forest percentage is the percentage of the sunlight going to the trees and not to crop species. In the plot simulator, this requires that the agricultural activity be limited but that forest growth be unimpeded.  This is because forest systems are calibrated to an endemic canopy cover for their location where a continuous forest cover definition applies (&gt;2m in height and &gt;20% canopy cover), but agricultural systems are calibrated to 100% sunlight.  If the forest fraction is <i>f</i>  then:</p>
<ul><li>Tree production (growth) is no different to if the plot were a forest plot.</li>
<li>Crop production (growth) is (1 – <i> f</i> ) times what it would be if the plot were wholly agricultural.</li>
<li>The mass present due to initial conditions in the soil and debris layers are scaled down by <i>f</i> and (1 - <i>f</i>) for forest and agricultural systems respectively.</li></ul>
<p>For example, suppose a mixed plot has the forest fraction equal to 30%. Then the forest growth is the same as what it would be if the whole plot were forest, but the agricultural growth is limited to 70% of what it would be if the whole plot were agricultural. The initial soil and debris levels in the forest system are 30% of what they would be if the whole plot were forest, and in the agricultural system are 70% of what they would be if the whole plot were agricultural. No non-growth processes are affected by the forest percentage.</p>
<p>The forest percentage can vary with time in response to events. <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/116_Forest Percentage Change.htm" target="_blank">Forest Percentage Change</a> events should be created when land management practices change alongside other events giving effect to that change, such as the removal or planting of trees. If <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/115_3PG.htm" target="_blank">3PG</a> is in use, the percentage can also change as the tree canopy grows.</p>

        <html><head><title>Latitude and Longitude</title>
<!--#include file="./incs/header.inc.htm"-->
<p><b>Latitude and Longitude</b></p>
<p>FullCAM's use of latitude and longitude.</p>
<p><b>Decimal Degrees</b></p>
<p>Always enter latitude and longitude in FullCAM in decimal degrees. All spatial measurements in FullCAM are defined and exact in terms of degrees, although we commonly speak of length approximations in kilometres or metres.</p>
<p>Latitude measures degrees from the equator; positive latitudes are in the northern hemisphere, negative latitudes are in the southern hemisphere (Australia is at about ñ30 degrees latitude). Goes from ñ90 deg N to +90 deg N (“N” is for = “north”).</p>
<p>Longitude measures degrees east of Greenwich, London. Goes from ñ180 deg E to +180 deg E (“E” is for “east”).</p>
<p><b>Conversion from Minutes and Seconds</b></p>
<p>To convert between decimal degrees and minutes and seconds:</p>
<blockquote><p>1 minute   =  1/60 degree

<br/>1 second = 1/ 60 minute = 1/3600 degree.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Example.</b> 12 degrees, 15 minutes and 1 second (12 deg 15’ 1”) is equal to</p>
<blockquote><p>12 degrees + 15 / 60 degrees + 1/3600 degrees

<br/>= 12 + 0.25 + 0.000277777778 degrees

<br/>= 12.25028 degrees (to about 1m precision)</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Length Approximations</b></p>
<p>One degree of latitude is roughly 100 km (closer to 110 km). Except near the poles, a degree of latitude is roughly equal in length to a degree of longitude. Thus:</p>
<ul><li>One hundredth of a degree (0.01 degrees) is about 1 km</li>
<li>Five decimal places gives about 1m precision (0.00001 degrees is about a metre).</li></ul>
<p><b>Example.</b> To move about 1 km west from 131.08123 deg E, move to 131.07123 deg E.</p>
<p>The size of a degree of longitude varies with latitude. For Australia, a degree of longitude at the tip of Cape York corresponds to approximately 109km, while at southern Tasmania it is approximately 80km.</p>
<p>We use these length approximations often when talking about spatial grids and cells, but the size of the cells and grids is defined in terms of degrees. For example, when we talk about a woodiness cell of “25 metres” or “25 m resolution” what we mean is the cell of the woodiness grid is 0.00025 degrees square ó as drawn on the ground, such a the cell has slightly curved edges, the northern and southern edges have slightly different lengths, and the northern and eastern edges may have quite different lengths.</p>
<p><b>Curvature of the Earth</b></p>
<p>Grids and their cells are specified as rectangles and squares respectively, as measured in degrees of latitude and longitude. Due to the curvature of the earth, the outline of the area of earth covered by a grid is not quite rectangular. Likewise, the cells are not quite square: the north-south side of each cell is not quite the same as the length of the east-west sides, and the east-west side nearer the equator is longer than the east-west side nearer the nearest pole.</p>
<p>FullCAM corrects for these effects when reporting areas, that is, FullCAM always reports true areas (areas as you would measure on the earth's surface).</p>
<p><b>Australia</b></p>
<p>Latitude and longitude coordinates must be from the Geographic Datum of Australia (GDA) system, not from the Australian Map Grid (AMG) system.</p>
<p>Mainland Australia and Tasmania extend approximately from latitude ñ10.6 deg N (Cape York, Queensland) to ñ43.6 deg N (South-east Cape, Tasmania), and longitude 113.2 deg E (Steep Point, Western Australia) to 153.6 deg E (Cape Byron, NSW).</p>

<p><b>XML Copy</b></p>
<p>[<i>Edit</i> toolbar : <i>XML Copy</i> (toggle on|off) menu item. ]

<br/>[FullCAMCL.exe -patch]</p>
<p>Describes the use of <i>XML Copy</i> and FullCAM Command Line <i>Patching</i>.</p>
<p><b>What is an XML Patch file</b></p>
<p>A <i>XML Patch</i> is a file containing a selection of FullCAM inputs which have been chosen via the <i>XML Copy</i> menu option and saved in a .xml file.<p>
<p>The .xml patch file can then be applied against a plot file which is simulated via the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/283_FullCAM Command Line Utility.htm" target="_blank">FullCAM Command Line</a>.</p>
<p>These "patches" serve as a type of scenario (see the plot digest tab help for an explanation of scenarios), being applied against a plot file overwriting the inputs at the time of simulation, but without modifying the .plo file.</p>
<p><b>Creating a XML Patch file</b></p>
<p>While having a plot file open that you wish to use to create patches, go to the FullCAM <i>Edit</i> menu and turn on <i>XML Copy</i> (a tick will appear next to it) .</p>
<p>With the toggle now turned on, navigate to the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/234_Explorer.htm" target="_blank">Explorer</a> tab, and in the left hand "Documents" panel browse to the input you wish to patch, and right mouse click the entry and select <i>Copy</i>.</p>
<p>Open notepad, or some other basic text editor (not Word or Excel), and paste the values. Multiple inputs can be entered into a single patch file, however only the first instance of <xmp>[<?xml version="1.0 encoding="utf-8?>]</xmp> and <xmp>[<docfragment version="5006">]</docfragment></xmp>, and final <xmp></xmp> should be kept, any further entries should have that row of text removed. Then save this text file as your XML patch file (with extension .xml).</p>
<p>Example XML Patch file: 

<pre><code><xmp>

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<docfragment version="5006">

  <inputelement option="" tin="hasArea" value="true"></inputelement>

  <inputelement option="" tin="areaBL" value="OneKm"></inputelement>

  <inputelement option="" tin="siteArea" value="1.0"></inputelement>

</docfragment>

</xmp></code></pre>
</p>
<p><b>Running the XML Patch file</b></p>
<p>With the file now created, FullCAMCL can now be run using the -patch command to apply the patch file aginst a plot file.<p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/283_FullCAM Command Line Utility.htm" target="_blank">FullCAMCL help</a> or use the -help flag within a command prompt.</p>
<p><b>Example 1:</b> To run a plot utilising a patch file: &gt; FullCAMCL.exe -sim -patch "patchfile.xml" ExamplePlot.plo</p>
<p><b>Example 2:</b> To apply a patch to an existing plot file: &gt; FullCAMCL.exe -update "patchfile.xml" ExamplePlot.plo</p>

        <html><head><title>Simulation Steps</title>
<!--#include file="./incs/header.inc.htm"-->
<p><b>Simulation Steps</b></p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/199_Timing.htm" target="_blank">Timing</a> page : <i>Simulation Steps</i> panel]</p>
<p>Set the amount of time in a simulation step (all simulation steps simulate the same amount of time).</p>
<p>A (simulation) <i>step</i> is the unit of time considered by a FullCAM simulation. In each step, there is exactly one material movement from one pool to the next pool due to processes (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/58_Processes and Events.htm" target="_blank">Processes and Events</a>). Each step always simulates the same amount of time. Steps are like the heartbeats of the model: material moves from pool to adjoining pool once per step (exception: more than once if the step is interrupted by an event).</p>
<p>The minimum time length per step is an hour.</p>
<p>The shorter the steps, the longer a plot simulation takes.</p>
<p><h3>Choosing the Number of Simulation Steps Per Year</h3></p>
<p><b><i>Time Resolution of Input Data</i></b></p>
<p>If you specify the rainfall to FullCAM as just the total rainfall each year (that is, one number per year), then it is unrealistic to expect FullCAM to accurately simulate monthly or weekly phenomena that are influenced by rainfall. Monthly simulation steps might be appropriate, but the results might have to be interpreted carefully.</p>
<p><b><i>Computing Time and Memory</i></b></p>
<p>In a very lengthy simulation or one with many outputs, there may not be enough computer memory to do a simulation with short steps, or it might take a long time to generate results.</p>
<p><b><i>Graininess</i></b></p>
<p>In FullCAM, each atom of material belongs to one pool (such as trees leaves), and carbon moves between the various pools once per step (at the end of the step). While the rate of circulation of material among the pools is mainly governed by the various physiological and empirical rate inputs, it is subtly influenced by the length of step and occasionally this is significant.</p>
<p>Consider carbon that flows from pool A to pool B to pool C (for example, tree leaves to leaf litter to soluble mulch). It takes one step for any carbon from pool A to reach pool B, and a second step for any of it to reach pool C. If the steps are yearly then it takes two years for ANY carbon from pool A to reach pool C, while with daily steps some carbon can get to pool C by the end of the second day.</p>
<p>In reality, the step length is vanishingly small: carbon moves between pools continuously, rather than in discrete movements that occur once every beat of our simulation clock. Now, we want to model the essential nature of the system with as little computing effort as possible. If we decrease the step length then we get a more realistic simulation, but we do more computing. This dependence of the simulation results on the step length is called <i>graininess</i>.</p>
<p>The precision of the quantities in FullCAM is relatively low so round-off error is almost insignificant — but there is little point in using more steps than necessary in case the round off error begins to affect your results. FullCAM's flexibility in its treatment of time allows you to overcome the artificial barriers set by arbitrary and fixed frequencies of simulations steps.</p>
<p>What is a sensible amount of time per step? As you decrease the step length, you will find your simulated results will gradually approach limiting values. The limiting values are simulation results that stay the same, no matter how much you further decrease the step length. From the perspective of graininess, an appropriate step length is the step length that gets you close to the limiting values.</p>
<p>As a rough rule of thumb, for negligible graininess use a step length of a month.

<p>When you download a species and set it as the initial species, the value of the forest percentage for downloading is used to compute the initial masses of the species. So if you later change the forest percentage for downloading, you will have to reset the initial species.</p>
<p><b>Download Spatial Data</b></p>
<p>Press the <i>Download Spatial Data</i> button to download the location specific data from the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/219_Departmental Server.htm" target="_blank">Departmental Server</a>. Text to the right of the window will then become visible showing the state and SA2 region for that the latitude and longitude resides within.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/215_Trees.htm" target="_blank">Tree</a> species, also displayed is the National Plantation Inventory Region (NPI), which are plantation regions published by ABARES, and the Growth Region, which are regions determining the availability of species for environmental and mallee plantings.</p>
<p>The Data Builder will download data for any point for which data is available within the extent used. The FullCAM Server has spatial data based on grids of varying resolutions from 25m to 1km.</p>
<p><b>Downloading Crops and Trees</b></p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/132_Data Builder.htm" target="_blank">Data Builder</a> page : <i>Trees and Crops</i> panel]</p>
<p>This panel is for downloading crop and tree species.</p>
<p><b>Basic Operation</b></p>
<ol><li>After downloading spatial data, select a species from the lower <i>Available Crops / Available Trees</i> lists, and press the <i>Download Species</i> button. This will download the species data to the plot and update the upper <i>Crop Species / Tree Species</i> lists.</li>
<li>Having the <i>Apply downloaded data</i> checkbox ticked will overwrite previously downloaded or manually entered species data within the plot.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Details</b></p>
<p>When downloading the first species to a plot, Data Builder will ask if you wish to make the species the initial species. We recommend you select “Yes”. This will populate the initial conditions parameters. The existence of and parameters for the initial species can be edited via the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/205_Initial Conditions.htm" target="_blank">Initial Conditions</a> tab. This is the preferred method of entering data into the initial conditions as all data points will contain required default data.</p>
<p>Once at least one crop or tree species has been downloaded, regimes and events are now ready to be added to the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/136_Events.htm" target="_blank">Event Queue</a>.</p>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The regime names aim to describe the types of management practices that will occur at a location. The regimes are species, location and time specific, being based on either National Plantation Inventory region or State.</p>
<p>The following text and table describes the regime names in the order they appear in the regime name. If more detailed information on a regime is required, or if the name is not exactly clear, place the mouse over the regime name. This will lead to a yellow text box appearing with a more detailed description of the regime.</p>
<p><b>National Plantation Inventory Region or State</b></p>
<p>This indicates the area in which the management system applies. The Data Builder automatically filters the available regimes for a species based on location. This field simply indicates that you are in the correct area. If the point falls within an NPI region, then this is reported, otherwise the regimes are filtered on a state basis</p>

<tr><td>Tas</td><td>Tasmania</td></tr></table>
<p><b>Previous Land Use</b></p>
<p>The initial conditions of a site and the site establishment techniques employed vary depending on the previous land use. The previous land use indicates the land use at the start of the simulation. For example, a previous land use of pasture means that the land use prior to establishing the forest was pasture. The ‘plantation’ previous land use is used to build multiple rotations and hence is only available after downloading an initial regime.</p>

<p><b>Site Productivity Estimate</b></p>
<p>A broad estimate of how productive the site is for a certain region. This generally determines factors such as timing of events and rotation length. Regimes with “recommended” after them are those that fit with the site productivity assessment of the National Carbon Accounting System.</p>
<p>If you feel that your site quality is much higher (i.e. deep fertile river flat with access to groundwater) or lower (rocky outcrops or badly degraded land) than reflected in the national account, you may select other options to suit your conditions. When doing this you may also need to adjust some other parameters in the model. For more information contact <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/190_Contact Us.htm" target="_blank">Contact Us</a>.</p>
<p><b>Timing</b></p>
<p>Gives the year range in which the management practices were applied. Management systems have varied considerably over the years as increased knowledge has lead to significant advances in plantation establishment and management.</p>
<p>The year range indicates the type of management that was common during that time period.</p>
<p><b>Site Preparation</b></p>
<p>Gives a description of the site preparation methods. These will vary with location, time and previous land-use. For example, StripWC means a strip weed control prior to planting, as is common in ex-pasture systems. BroadBurn indicates a broadcast burn, as may be applied after clearing or felling of existing trees.</p>

<p><b>Thins</b></p>
<p>Indicates the number of thins prior to final harvest. For example, a pulpwood plantation will have no thins, just a final harvest. Non-commercial plantings (such as environmental or amenities plantings) have no harvesting and are listed as NoHarvest.</p>
<table><tr><th>Code</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>1Thin</td><td>1 thin prior to final harvest</td></tr>

<tr><td>NoThin</td><td>No thin prior to final harvest</td></tr>
<tr><td>NoHarvest</td><td>No harvesting (i.e. environmental planting)</td></tr></table>
<p><b>Prunes</b></p>
<p>Indicates the number of prunes during a rotation. Typically these occur around the time of thinning, but this is not always the case.</p>
<table><tr><th>Code</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<p><b>Fertilisation</b></p>
<p>Indicates the number of fertilisation events and when they occur (i.e. at or near time of establishment, or later after thinning for example).</p>
<table><tr><th>Code</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>1LateAgeFert</td><td>1 late age fertilisation (normally after thinning)</td></tr>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>Various constituent models need to know the rainfall: <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/114_RothC.htm" target="_blank">RothC</a>, <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/77_CAMFor.htm" target="_blank">CAMFor</a> (if the breakdown of the debris of any tree species is sensitive to temperature and rainfall), and <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/78_CAMAg.htm" target="_blank">CAMAg</a> (if the breakdown of the debris of any crop species is sensitive to temperature and rainfall).</p>
<p>Rainfall can be supplemented by definite irrigation.</p>
<p><b>Natural</b></p>
<p>The soil model <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/114_RothC.htm" target="_blank">RothC</a> requires details of open-pan evaporation, in order to work out the topsoil moisture deficit (TSMD).</p>
<p><b>Irrigation</b></p>
<p>The irrigation in the forest and agricultural systems of a plot are entirely separate, and no water runs from one system to the other.</p>
<p><i>Definite irrigation</i> is irrigation that definitely occurs, regardless of conditions. If you have historical irrigation data, enter it as definite irrigation and turn off conditional irrigation. See the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/92_Definite Irrigation.htm" target="_blank">Definite Irrigation</a> time series.</p>
<p><i>Conditional irrigation</i> is irrigation whose occurrence depends on the conditions. Specify a minimum percentage of the maximum soil water capacity in the conditional irrigation time series, and FullCAM applies just enough irrigation to guarantee that the soil water never drops below this amount. Thus, conditional irrigation ensures a minimum level of soil water - irrigation is used as conditions require. Use conditional irrigation to simulate the effect of a management practice that uses irrigation to ensure a minimum soil water level. Setting the conditional irrigation percentage to 0% effectively turns off conditional irrigation. See the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/91_Conditional Irrigation.htm" target="_blank">Conditional Irrigation</a> time series.</p>
<p>The forest and agricultural water simulations are separate (FullCAM assumes no lateral water movement on the plot), except that they share the same rainfall, open-pan evaporation, and VPD. The forest and agricultural irrigations are entirely separate.</p>
<p>Irrigation levels can be specified either with events or with time series (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/195_Configure event or time-series.htm" target="_blank">Configure Event Or Time Series</a>). If using time series, enter the time series via the buttons on this window. If using events, enter the events on the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/136_Events.htm" target="_blank">Events</a> page. In either case, enter all information about irrigation (namely whether conditional irrigation is on, and which model it uses to operate in the forest).</p>
<p><b>Forest Irrigation</b></p>
<p>RothC calculates soil water as a deficit, as the <i>topsoil moisture deficit</i> (TSMD). The RothC soil water capacity (corresponds to a TSMD of zero when the soil is at its wettest, but equal to the maximum TSMD when the soil is at its driest) is calculated by RothC from the soil sample depth, the ratio of bare-to-covered maximum TSMD, and the clay fraction — input these in the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/44_Soil Water.htm" target="_blank">Soil Water</a> window and <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/46_Soil for the Whole Plot.htm" target="_blank">Soil for the Whole Plot</a> panel, respectively.</p>
<p><b>Agricultural Irrigation</b></p>
<p>Only the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/114_RothC.htm" target="_blank">RothC</a> model runs an agricultural soil water model. You can use conditional irrigation whenever the soil is included in the plot. See the remarks on RothC in the forest irrigation section above.</p>

<br/>This <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/135_time-series window.htm" target="_blank">Time Series Window</a> is where enter the forest productivity index (FPI) for the plot.</p>
<p><b>Forest Productivity Index (FPI)</b></p>
<p>This window provides options for computing the FPI, which is required if the tree yield formula is used to compute tree growth. It is a simplified variant of the 3PG model and produces a time-series (monthly or annual) index that is equivalent to a site class.</p>
<p>As an alternative to calculating the FPI, a value from the NCAS modelling can be obtained for the latitude and longitude specified in the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/132_Data Builder.htm" target="_blank">Data Builder</a> window.</p>
<p><b>Details</b></p>
<p>The FPI is used if the tree production method is the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/130_Tree Yield Formula.htm" target="_blank">Tree Yield Formula</a> and the FPI is not calculated from scratch (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/108_Configure Tree Production.htm" target="_blank">Configure Tree Production</a>).</p>
<p>The FPI is a dimensionless measure of site productivity due to soil, sunlight, rainfall, evaporation, and frost. The FPI varies during the year. The FPI is described in <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/./reps/TR27 Biomass Estimation Approaches for Assessment of Stocks and Stock Change.pdf" target="_blank">NCAS Technical Report No.27</a>, with recent updates being described by Paul and Roxburgh (2019). Improved FullCAM-prediction of woody growth increments. Report prepared for the Department of the Environment and Energy. CSIRO Land and Water, Canberra.</p>
<p>Enter the FPI as an “annualised rate”, which is what the FPI would be if it continued at that rate for a whole year. Thus the FPI is like temperature (if only the annual figure is given, the annual figure applies in each month), rather than like rainfall  (if only the annual figure is given, one twelfth of the annual figure in each month). In FullCAM, the FPI is always reported as an annualised rate.</p>
<p>FPI values range from 0 to 100, but the average FPI over a year rarely exceeds 25. On a good site the FPI might vary between 6 in a poor month to 60 in the best month. However the average of the FPI over a year is rarely more than 25. Thus the yearly average of the numbers you enter should only exceed 25 for exceptionally productive sites.</p>
<p>If actual site data is available, enter it in this time series. If not, use <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/132_Data Builder.htm" target="_blank">Data Builder</a> to download estimated monthly FPI. The derivation of this data is described in <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/./reps/TR23 Developing a National Forest Productivity Model.pdf" target="_blank">NCAS Technical Report No.23</a>.</p>
<p>The FullCAM model utilises the Tree Yield Formula (Eq. 1, Waterworth et al. 2007) to predict increments in above-ground biomass (AGB) within forests, woodlands, shrublands and plantations.</p>
<p>AGB = M x <i>y</i> x [exp(-k / A2) - exp(-k / A1) ] x (FPIt / FPIave)    <b>Eq. 1</b></p>
<p>where,

AGB = Current annual increment in above-ground biomass (AGB, Mg DM ha-1 year-1)

M is the maximum AGB in undisturbed native vegetation (Mg DM ha-1), and for Australian vegetation is estimated as:

      M = (6.011 sqrt(FPIave) - 5.291)<sup>2</sup> (Waterworth et al. 2007).
<i>y</i> = value of the Type 2 multiplier to account for factors that increase growth potential at a given site (e.g. planting configuration, Snowdon 2002)

A1, A2 = age (years) in year 1 and 2, respectively, etc.

k = 2 x G - 1.25, where G = tree age of maximum growth rate (years),

FPIt = Annual Forest Productivity Index over the period A1 to A2, and is the sum of key sitefactors (soil type, fertility and climate) driving growth, regardless of the type of planting or its age (Kesteven and Landsberg 2004); and

FPIave = mean long-term average annual forest productivity index, which is independent of age (Kesteven and Landsberg 2004).</p>
<p>In FullCAM, inter-annual variation in climatic conditions (e.g. intermittent droughts) are accounted for by annually adjusting the TYF predicted increment in woody growth by the fraction:</p>
<p>FPIt / FPIave    <b>Eq. 2</b></p>
<p>Hence, in a drought year where FPIt &lt; FPIave, the growth increments are adjusted down.</p>
<p>Across the period of simulation, the average increment multiplier given in Eq. 2 needs to be close to 1.0 to enable the default TYF curve to attain the expected long-term maximum above-ground biomass of the stand (M) is attained. Due to the formulation of FullCAM's TYF, M will not be achieved if FPIave is less than the mean of the FPIt values for the years across which the simulation is run. Running a simulation over a period across which the average of the FPIt values are x% lower (or higher) than the FPIave will, for all years, result in biomass predictions that are x% lower (or higher than) the default TYF curve with a maximum AGB equal to M. Care is therefore required when considering the definition of FPIave. The definition of FPIave applied in the TYF is the average of the FPIt values between the years 1970 and 2017. This definition of FPIave is what is downloaded automatically from the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/132_Data Builder.htm" target="_blank">Data Builder</a>. However, for years for which there is no FPI data available, and where the user has selected to extrapolate FPI data based on the average, FPIt is taken to be the average of the FPIt values observed over the period of simulation. To enable this, an exception is applied in the first year without an observed value for FPIt. For that year, an adjustment is applied to prevent the last year with an observed FPIt from having undue influence on estimates over time.</p>

<p>[<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/200_Site.htm" target="_blank">Site</a> page : <i>Growth Multipliers</i> button]</p>
<p>Enter information about growth variations on the plot compared to the standard site for which the plant growth information is intended.</p>
<p><b>Use</b></p>
<p>The growth multipliers multiply the growth of the trees and crops, to reflect site variation from a standard site.</p>
<p>Each input multiplies the growth of its component in every step of the simulation. A setting of 1.0 is neutral (no adjustment); a setting of 1.10 will cause the plant component to grow 10% more than the amount otherwise calculated; a setting of 0.0 cuts off growth altogether. “Growth” here means NPP if the growth is calculated using NPPs, or yield if the growth is calculated using yields.</p>
<p>These inputs should generally remain neutral (that is, 1.0) when developing a model, but may be used to model the effect of different environmental conditions — such as less allocation to roots with better moisture and nutrient availability. These growth multipliers can be used as a shortcut to altering the relative growth tables.</p>

<p>Enter information about the area of the plot.</p>
<p><b>Use</b></p>
<p>Choose either:</p>
<ol><li>No Area - The plot model is a <i>point</i> model — it has no area, but represents a typical hectare. Output masses are reported in tonnes per hectare.</li>
<li>Area - The plot is a piece of land with a specified area. Output masses are reported in tonnes.</li></ol>
<p>The choice only affects the way the outputs are reported. Relative to the <i>No area</i> choice, the outputs under the <i>Area</i> choice are multiplied by the specified area in hectares (for appropriate outputs).</p>
<p><b>Example</b>. Suppose that when you choose <i>No Area</i> the mass of carbon in the trees after a simulation is 20 t/ ha. If you change your choice to <i>Area</i> and specify the area as 7 hectares, when you rerun the simulation the reported mass of carbon in the trees will be 140 t (20 t/ ha * 7 ha = 140 t).</p>
<p>If economic modelling is on (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/138_Configure Other Options.htm" target="_blank">Configure Other Options</a>), then the "Area" option is automatically chosen and you will need to have a valid area (enter 1 hectare as the area if you effectively want the output masses to be "per hectare").</p>

<p>Enter information about the maximum aboveground biomass that can be supported by the plot.</p>
<p>The <i>aboveground biomass</i> is the combined mass of the aboveground plant components:</p>
<ul><li>For tree systems: Stems, branches, bark, and leaves</li>
<li>For agricultural systems: Grains, buds, fruit, stalks, and leaves.</li></ul>
<p>It does not include the roots, debris, standing dead material, mulch, or soil matter. It is measured in tonnes per hectare of dry matter (tDM/ha).</p>
<p>The maximum aboveground biomass provides an upper limit on the amount of aboveground biomass of trees and crops that can exist on the plot during a simulation.</p>
<p>The growth of plants is calculated as specified under <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/42_Growth Properties.htm" target="_blank">Growth Properties</a>. After growth and turnover has been calculated for the plant components, if the aboveground biomass of the plants exceeds the maximum aboveground biomass for the site, then the masses of all of the plant components are reduced, in proportion to their pre-reduction masses.</p>
<p>If the aboveground biomass of the plants never exceeds the maximum aboveground biomass, then the maximum aboveground biomass has no effect on the simulation — except if the Tree Yield Formula is used, in which case the maximum forest aboveground biomass affects the tree growth rate at all times (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/42_Growth Properties.htm" target="_blank">Growth Properties</a>).</p>
<p>If you do not wish there to be any upper limit on growth in cases where the Tree Yield Formula is not being applied, simply set the maximum aboveground biomass to a number high enough so as not to act as a limiting effect (such as 9,999) — effectively rendering it inoperative.</p>
<p><b>Relationship to the Tree Yield Formula</b></p>
<p>For tree systems and mixed systems, if the option to use the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/130_Tree Yield Formula.htm" target="_blank">Tree Yield Formula</a> is used (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/108_Configure Tree Production.htm" target="_blank">Configure Tree Production</a>), the aboveground biomass of the trees will asymptotically approach the specified maximum aboveground biomass.</p>
<p>Information on aboveground biomass estimates can be found in NCAS Technical Report No.44 and Roxburgh <i>et al.</i> 2019. Values for <i>Maximum Aboveground Biomass</i> can be downloaded from the FullCAM server using <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/132_Data Builder.htm" target="_blank">Data Builder</a> for specified spatial coordinates.</p>

<p><b>Plantation Species simulations</b></p>
<p>When simulating a plantation tree species, changing this maximum aboveground biomass (M) value will make the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/130_Tree Yield Formula.htm" target="_blank">Tree Yield Formula</a> default parameters (G and <i>r</i>) invalid.

<p>Default parameters which control the growth, root:shoot ratios, turnover rates, debris decay, and so on, are also downloaded along with the species. These may then be edited by hand via the windows opened from this page.</p>
<p>If there are no plants growing and the system is clear, then planting events, namely <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/158_Plant Trees.htm" target="_blank">Plant Trees</a> or <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/161_Plant Crop.htm" target="_blank">Plant Crop</a>, can set plants growing on the plot.

<p>By clearing one species then planting a different species, a plot can have several different species growing during the plot simulation - but only one species growing in a system at any one time.</p>
<p>The debris and products from each species are tracked separately, because they have characteristics that may differ from species to species. However, all species are treated the same with respect to the mulch and soil - different species merely have different proportions of decomposable or resistant material.</p>

<ol><li><i>Sigmoidal</i> - Use for annual species. Grows using a sigmoidal curve to achieve the target yield amount.</li>
<li><i>Perennial</i> - Used for modelling perennial pastures. The growth curve is constructed from an initial value and steply (generally monthly) increments of growth and die-off.</li></ol>
</p>
<p>A more detailed description on the different types of Crop and Pasture growth is detailed on the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/118_Crop Growth Increments.htm" target="_blank">Crop growth page</a>.</p>

<p><b>Allocations</b></p>
<p>The allocation time series specify the growth of the plant components. An allocation time series is required for each plant component.</p>
<p>The numbers in the allocation time series are the <b><i>relative</i></b> allocations of yield or NPP to the various plant components and they must be positive numbers. (See <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/135_Time-Series Window.htm" target="_blank">Time Series Window</a>.)</p>
<p><b>Increments</b></p>
<p>An increment time series specifies the increase in one or a combination of plant components. Only one increment time series is used by the species Ś select one by clicking on the radio button to the left of the rectangular button displaying the name of the increment time series.</p>

<p><b>Parameters in the Tree Yield Formula</b></p>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/130_Tree Yield Formula.htm" target="_blank">Tree Yield Formula</a>. Variation in site, management, species and other factors greatly impact forest growth and hence, vary growth curve characteristics.</p>
<p>Enter the tree age in years at which the treeÆs growth (measured in tonnes per year) is highest. This is <i>G</i> in the description of the yield formula.</p>
<p>The roles of the non-endemic species multiplier <i>r</i> of the maximum aboveground biomass <i>M</i> (entered in the <i>Site : Maximum Aboveground Biomass</i> panel) are:</p>
<ul><li>To change the effective maximum biomass in the tree yield formula from <i>M</i> to <i>r * M</i>.</li>
<li>To change the maximum tree biomass limit for the plot from <i>M</i> to <i>r * M</i>.</li></ul>
<p>Because <i>r</i> is species-dependent, the siteÆs growth rate and maximum biomass can vary by species for the same site. Normally r will be close to 1 (assuming that <i>M</i>, entered in the <i>Site : Maximum Aboveground Biomass</i> panel, is a realistic value).</p>
<p>When using <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/132_Data Builder.htm" target="_blank">Data Builder</a> to download tree species, the values of <i>G</i> and <i>r</i> or <i>y</i> that it downloads to your plot are based on statistically calibrated models.</p>
<p><b><i>Calculation of G and r for plantation tree species</i></b></p>
<p>Default vaules for plantation tree species are based on statistically calibrated models that are unique to combinations of regions and management factors.</p>
<p>The age of maximum biomass increment <i>G</i> varies with productivity and management regime. It is calculated using a linear model:</p>
<p><blockquote><i>G = ag + bg * M</i></blockquote></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><i>M</i> =  Maximum aboveground biomass of trees, in tdm/ha (<i>Site</i> page). This is the unadjusted value, prior to multiplication by <i>r</i> and prior to any type 2 forest treatments.</p>
<p><i>ag</i> = Maximum age at which the trees reach maximum aboveground biomass increment at the lowest <i>M</i> values (that is, on the lowest quality site on which the plantation species is used). <i>ag</i> is constant for a given species, but varies between species.</p>
<p><i>bg</i> = Multiplier. Constant for a given species, but varies between species.</p>
<p>Thus, for a given species, the downloaded <i>G</i> only varies with <i>M</i>.</p>
<p>The non-endemic species multiplier <i>r</i> varies with region and management regime. It is calculated by:</p>
<p><blockquote><i>r</i> = exp(<i>ar</i> + <i>br</i> * ln(<i>M</i>)) = exp(<i>ar</i>) * (<i>M</i> ^ <i>br</i>)</blockquote></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><i>M</i> =  As defined above.</p>
<p><i>ar</i> = Constant, Depends on rotation length and region. <i>ar</i> is constant for a given species, but varies between species.</p>
<p><i>br</i> = Multiplier. Depends on the region. Constant for a given species, but varies between species.</p>
<p><blockquote><i>x</i> ^ <i>y</i>   = <i>x</i> to the power of <i>y</i> (for example, 5 ^ 2 = 25).</blockquote></p>
<p>This equation only applies within a range of allowable <i>r * M</i> values in which a species is expected to occur. If <i>r*M</i> exceeds parameter <i>r*Mmax</i>, then <i>r</i> is set to <i>r*Mmax/M</i> and <i>G</i> is assigned parameter <i>Gmax</i>. Conversely, if <i>r*M</i> is less than parameter <i>r*Mmin</i>, then <i>r</i> is set to <i>r*Mmin/M</i> and <i>G</i> is assigned parameter <i>Gmin</i>. This provides a growth curve that is consistent with the maximum (<i>Mmax</i>) and minimum (<i>Mmin</i>) feasible values of <i>M</i> for the species.</p>

        <html><head><title>Yield and NPP</title>
<!--#include file="./incs/header.inc.htm"-->
<p><b>Yield and NPP</b></p>
<p>Yield and NPP are related concepts and you will need to know how they are defined in order to understand plant growth in FullCAM.</p>
<p><b>Turnover</b></p>
<p>A plant is normally “turning over” or shedding material, producing “litterfall” aboveground and “root slough” belowground.</p>
<p><b>NPP</b></p>
<p>The net increase in plant mass due to the addition of new plant material is called the <i>net primary production</i> (NPP), which includes the effects of both photosynthesis and respiration. NPP is difficult to measure due to the confounding effect of <i>turnover</i> (in which all plant components except tree stems lose portions via turnover), and is of interest mainly to people tracking tree physiology.</p>
<p>NPP is due to the combined effects of photosynthesis and respiration. The mass added by photosynthesis is called <i>gross primary production</i> (GPP). It is photosynthesis that removes carbon from the atmosphere and adds it to the plant. However, much of the GPP is promptly lost (and carbon returned to the atmosphere) due to respiration. In trees, NPP is typically about half of GPP. In FullCAM, NPP is measured in tonnes per hectare.</p>
<p>Thus, in normal growth, a plant is simultaneously adding to its mass by the process of production (which adds NPP to the plant) and losing mass by the process of turnover (which loses material from the plant).</p>
<p><b>Yield</b></p>
<p>Due to the turnover of plant components, when we measure the change in component mass over a period of time we actually measure the<i> yield</i>, which is the NPP less the turnover. Yield is relatively easy to measure and is of interest to anyone who measures plant masses.</p>
<p>The yield of a plant is the NPP produced less the material shed by turnover: in any given period,</p>
<p><i>Yield = NPP – Turnover</i>.</p>
<p><b>Use NPP or Yield?</b></p>
<p>NPP is due to production, material-turned-over is due to turnover, and yield is due to the combined effects of production and turnover.</p>
<p>There are two fundamentally different ways of specifying or measuring plant growth:</p>
<ol><li>By yield changes — changes in yield with time.</li>
<li>By NPP flows — amounts of NPP added to the plant component.</li></ol>
<p>In practice, the material-turned-over is hard to measure precisely as material moving to debris via turnover is quickly dispersed into the environment, while yields are relatively easy to measure precisely.</p>
<p>The yield is what you get if you simply measure the mass of the specified plant component(s), and a “mass increment” (or “yield increment”) is the difference in measurements of mass over the period of the increment.</p>
<p>For example, if you measure the leaves of the trees of a forest as 20 tdm/ha on June 1 then the yield of the tree leaves on June 1 is 20 tdm/ha. If you then measure the leaves of the trees as 26 tdm/ha on August 1, the mass increment of the tree leaves is 6 tdm/ha over those two months. If your increment time series contained monthly leaf mass increments, then it might have 3 tdm/ha in June and another 3 tdm/ha in July.</p>
<p>An NPP flow to a tree or crop component in a given period is the mass of NPP that is added to the component in the period.</p>
<p>For example, continuing the previous example, suppose that the trees shed 1 tdm/ha of leaves during June and a further 2 tdm/ha of leaves in July. Then the NPP flowing to the leaves in June must have been 4 tdm/ha (the leaf mass increment was 3 tdm/ha in June, which included shedding 1 tdm/ha of leaves) and in July must have been 5 tdm/ha (3 tdm/ha net gain, including a 2 tdm/ha loss). If your increment time series contained monthly leaf NPP flows, then it would have 4 tdm/ha in June and another 5 tdm/ha in July.</p>

        <html><head><title>Tree Yield Formula</title>
<!--#include file="./incs/header.inc.htm"-->
<p><b>Tree Yield Formula</b></p>
<p>The tree yield formula is one of the tree production methods in a multilayer forest (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/108_Configure Tree Production.htm" target="_blank">Configure Tree Production</a>). It is an equation for calculating tree growth, whose main inputs are maximum aboveground biomass, tree age, and productivity.</p>
<p><b>The Tree Yield Formula</b></p>
<p>The tree yield formula for tree growth is</p>
<p><blockquote><i>T(A) = r * M * y *</i>  exp(<i>ñk / d</i>)</blockquote></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><i>T</i>  =  Aboveground mass of the trees, in tdm/ha, if there was constant (and thus average) productivity</p>
<p><i>A</i>  =  Age of the tree (either the age of the oldest trees, or the average age of the trees ó see the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/42_Growth Properties.htm" target="_blank">Growth Properties</a> window), in years</p>
<p><i>M</i> =  Maximum aboveground biomass of trees, in tdm/ha (<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/200_Site.htm" target="_blank">Site</a> page)</p>
<p><i>r</i>   =  Maximum aboveground biomass multiplier (<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/42_Growth Properties.htm" target="_blank">Growth Properties</a> window), a species-dependent modifier of <i>M</i> (thus the maximum aboveground biomass used is <i>r * M</i>)</p>
<p><i>y</i>   =  Tree yield multiplier. Initially equal to one in any plot simulation, then changed to the type 2 growth multiplier of the latest forest treatment event</p>
<p><i>k</i>   =  <i>2 * G</i>  ñ 1.25.</p>
<p><blockquote><i>G</i>  =  Tree age of maximum growth, in years (<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/42_Growth Properties.htm" target="_blank">Growth Properties</a> window, expressed as a multiplier of the maximum aboveground biomass plus a constant). This is also usually the age at which the canopy closes.</blockquote></p>
<p><i>d</i>   =  Adjusted age of the trees, in years</p>
<blockquote><p>=  <i>A</i> + sum over each treatment of</p>
<table><tr><td>0</td><td width="5"></td><td>if <i>A &lt;= W</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><i>v * (A ñ W) / U</i></td><td width="5"></td><td>if <i>A &gt;= W</i>   and  <i> A &lt;= W + U</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><i>v</i></td><td width="5"></td><td>if <i>A &gt; W + U</i></td></tr></table>
<p>where, for each treatment undergone by the forest, specified by the type 1 parameters in the forest treatment events,</p>
<p><i>v</i>    =  the age advance due to the treatment, either positive or negative, in years

<br/><i>U</i>   =  the advancement period, in years

<br/><i>W</i>  =  the age (of same type as <i>A</i>) at which the treatment was applied, in years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Notes</b></p>
<p><i>T</i> asymptotically approaches <i>r * M * y</i> from below as <i>d</i> increases. Note that exp(0) = 1, exp(negative) &lt; 1, and exp(any) &gt; 0. The maximum aboveground biomass for trees when the tree yield formula is in use is <i>r * M * y</i>. The forest treatment events move the forest back and forth along the growth-age curve described by the tree yield formula, where each age advance is phased in linearly over the advancement period. When the tree yield formula is in use (that is, the current tree species uses the tree yield formula to determine its growth), all age-based properties of the trees use the adjusted age of the trees (<i>d</i>), including the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/112_Tree Growth Allocations.htm" target="_blank">Tree Growth Allocations</a>, <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/121_Mortality.htm" target="_blank">Mortality</a>, and <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/9_Stem Density.htm" target="_blank">Stem Density</a> time series.</p>
<p><b>Non-Constant Productivity</b></p>
<p>The tree yield formula above gives the generic biomass yield curve under average climatic conditions. To account for year-to-year variations in climatic data, the tree yield formula-predicted increment in aboveground biomass is moderated up or down at annual time steps based on the ratio of the forest productivity index to the average forest productivity index. See <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/188_Forest Productivity Index.htm" target="_blank">Forest Productivity Index</a>.</p>
<p><b>Data Inputs to the Formula</b></p>
<p>Thus the data inputs to the tree yield formula are:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>M</i>, the maximum aboveground biomass</li>
<li><i>r</i>, the species-multiplier of the maximum aboveground biomass</li>
<li><i>G</i>, the tree age of maximum growth</li>
<li><i>FPI</i>, the time series of the forest productivity index</li>
<li><i>y</i>, the tree yield multiplier (which can be changed by type 2 forest treatment events)</li>
<li>The age advances specified by the type 1 forest treatment events.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/219_Departmental Server.htm" target="_blank">Departmental Server</a>, <i>r</i> and <i>G</i> are calculated from other inputs.

<p>This <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/135_time-series window.htm" target="_blank">Time Series Window</a> is one of the tree allocation time series windows, where you specify the relative allocations of yield or NPP (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/131_Yield and Net Primary Production.htm" target="_blank">Yield and NPP</a>) to the six tree components: stems, branches, bark, leaves, coarse roots, or fine roots.</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The allocations determine the growth of a component, relative to the other components. A high allocation means more growth of the component compared to the other components, a low allocation means the component grows slower than the other components. Hence, allocations are purely relative: it is not the size of the numbers by themselves that matters, only the ratios between the allocations to the various tree components.</p>
<p>Typically the stem (or bole) growth is the frame of reference, and the mass increases of the other components relative to the stems are recorded. If the relative stem growth is set to 1.0, then where the leaf mass increment is a half of the stem mass increment it would be set to 0.5.</p>
<p>Data on allocations to various tree components can be found in the NCAS Technical Reports <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/./reps/TR5A Review of Allometric Relationships for Estimating Woody Biomass for Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia.pdf" target="_blank">5a</a>, <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/./reps/TR5B Review of Allometric Relationships for Estimating Woody Biomass for New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia.pdf" target="_blank">5b</a>, <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/./reps/TR17 Synthesis of Allometrics, Review of Root Biomass and Design of Future Woody Biomass Sampling Strategies.pdf" target="_blank">17</a>, <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/./reps/TR25 Review of Unpublished Biomass-Related Information Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland.pdf" target="_blank">25</a> and <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/./reps/TR44 Spatial Estimates of Biomass in 'Mature' Native Vegetation.pdf" target="_blank">44</a> (<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/./reps/TR17 Synthesis of Allometrics, Review of Root Biomass and Design of Future Woody Biomass Sampling Strategies.pdf" target="_blank">17</a> is the synthesis report).

<p><b>Crop Growth Allocations</b></p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/42_Growth Properties.htm" target="_blank">Growth Properties</a> window (for crops) : Any of the <i>Allocations</i> buttons]</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/135_time-series window.htm" target="_blank">Time Series Window</a> is one of the crop allocation time series windows, where you specify the relative allocations of yield or NPP (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/131_Yield and Net Primary Production.htm" target="_blank">Yield and NPP</a>) to the five crop components: GBF (grains, buds, and fruit), stalks, leaves, coarse roots, or fine roots.</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The allocations determine the growth of the component, relative to the other crop components. A high allocation means more growth of the component compared to the other components, a low allocation means the component grows slower than the other components. The crop components all grow in certain proportions to one another at various stages in the plant’s life; these allocations are the mechanism for determining those proportions in FullCAM.</p>
<p>Enter an allocation for each period in the time series. The allocations are purely relative: it is not the size of the numbers by themselves that matters, only the ratios between the allocations to the various crop components.</p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>In these examples we will assume yield allocations. Thus we are concerned only with the mass increases of the crop components, relative to one another.</p>
<p><b>Example 1</b>. Suppose in a given period of crop growth that the mass of the stalks in a hectare of crop increases by 2 tonnes, while the mass of leaves on the same hectare increases by 3.5 tonnes. Then the ratio of stalk growth to leaf growth is 3.5 / 2 or 1.75. Thus the relative yield allocations factors of stalks and leaves are respectively x and 1.75<i>x</i>, where <i>x</i> is any non-negative number. You might choose any of the following as the relative yield allocations for that year:</p>
<ul><li>Stalk allocation is 1.0 and leaf allocation is 1.75 (stalks are the reference component).</li>
<li>Stalk allocation is 0.5714 and leaf allocation is 1.0  (leaves are the reference component)</li>
<li>Stalk allocation is 100 and leaf allocation is 175.</li></ul>
<p><b>Example 2</b>. Suppose that in a given one month period of crop growth that, in a hectare of crop, the mass increases in the components over the period were as follows:</p>
<blockquote><table><tr><th>Vegetation Component</th><th>tdm/ha value</th></tr>
<tr><td>GBF</td><td align="center">2.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stalks</td><td align="center">5.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Leaves</td><td align="center">20.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Coarse roots</td><td align="center">10.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fine roots</td><td align="center">1.0</td></tr></table></blockquote>
<p>One choice of relative yield allocations (all relative to the GBF allocation) for this period would be:</p>
<blockquote><table><tr><th>Vegetation Component</th><th>Relative Yield</th></tr>
<tr><td>GBF</td><td align="center">1.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stalks</td><td align="center">2.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Leaves</td><td align="center">10.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Coarse roots</td><td align="center">5.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fine roots</td><td align="center">0.5</td></tr></table></blockquote>
<p>Another choice (stalk growth as reference) would be:</p>
<blockquote><table><tr><th>Vegetation Component</th><th>Relative Yield</th></tr>
<tr><td>GBF</td><td align="center">0.4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stalks</td><td align="center">1.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Leaves</td><td align="center">4.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Coarse roots</td><td align="center">2.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fine roots</td><td align="center">0.2</td></tr></table></blockquote>

<p>This <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/135_time-series window.htm" target="_blank">Time Series Window</a> is one of the following two crop and pasture time series windows, where you specify the:</p>
<p><b>1. Growth</b> of the crop or pasture as either:</p>
<ul><li>Mass increments of the specified crop or pasture components [tdm/ha]</li>
<li>NPP flows to various crop or pasture components [tdm/ha].</li></ul>
<p><b>2. Die off</b>, for perennial pastures only, as either:</p>
<ul><li>Mass decrements of leaf components [tdm/ha]</li>
<li>NPP flows from leaf components [tdm/ha].</li></ul>
<p><b>Details</b></p>
<p>Crops and pastures may be grown via three different methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Sigmoidal</i> (for annual species) - growth will begin from the planting event and proceed to the harvest event, tracking along a sigmoidal curve. At the time of harvest, the plant will have reached optimal growth, which is the amount specified within the increment growth window. This value should normally be an annual value.</li>
<li><i>Perennial growth</i> (for perennial/multi-year species) - growth will begin at time of planting from an initial standing dry matter amount, and proceed using monthly increments and decrements. Perennial growth can be used to accurately model seasonal variations and climatic impacts on pasture yields.</li>
<li><i>Linear</i> - growth will begin from the planting event and proceed to the harvest event, tracking linearly from planting to harvest. At the time of harvest, the plant will have reached optimal growth, which is the amount specified within the increment growth window. This value should normally be an annual value. Linear growth is not recommended for modelling plant growth as it produces unrealistic amounts of biomass at any point along the growth time series.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional detail and reference material on sigmoidal and perennial growth methods can be found within Australia's National Inventory Report.</p>
<p><b>Additional Comments</b></p>
<p>Crop and pasture growth within FullCAM does not take into account climatic variability. It will simply model growth along a set curve to reach the optimal yield as entered. The yields that are entered into FullCAM should include climatic impacts into their modelling or measurement prior to insertion into FullCAM.</p>

<p><b>Carbon Percentages</b></p>
<p>The carbon percentage of a tree or crop component is the mass of carbon in the component.</p>
<p>The carbon percentages for a range of tree components can be found in the NCAS Technical Reports No.s <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/reps/TR7 Carbon Content of Woody Roots Revised Analysis and a Comparison with Woody Shoot Components (Revision 1).pdf" target="_blank">7</a> and <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/reps/TR22 Carbon Contents of Above-Ground Tissues of Forest and Woodland Trees.pdf" target="_blank">22</a>.</p>

<p><b>Turnover Percentages</b></p>
<p>Turnover represents the part of a plant component being shed by the plant. Turnover material is dead, and moves to the debris. All of the parts of a plant except tree stems are subject to turnover.</p>
<p>The turnover percentage of a plant pool determines how much material is turned over. Setting a turnover percentage to 0 means that there is no turnover. A turnover percentage of 100% means that in each simulation step all of the pool dies and moves to debris, so the only material in the pool at the end of the step is new material that was produced during the step.</p>
<p>In FullCAM, turnover rates are assumed to be constant throughout the year using the same turnover fraction in every simulation step. This would be an unrealistic assumption for the turnover of leaves for deciduous trees and perennial grasses.</p>
<p>The turnover percentage of a plant pool is the percentage lost per year due to turnover. It assumes exponential decay at a constant decay rate.</p>
<p>Typical turnover rates for trees are described in Table 10 of the report <i>Land Use Change in Australia: In Integrated Application of the National Carbon Accounting System</i>. Turnover rates for additional species can be extracted from the FullCAM database.</p>

<p><b>Standing Dead</b></p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/201_Plants.htm" target="_blank">Trees</a> page : <i>Properties of the Species</i> panel : <i>Standing Dead</i> button]</p>
<p>Specify the properties of the standing dead pools produced by the current species (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/56_Select a Species.htm" target="_blank">Select a Species</a>).</p>
<p><b>About standing dead pools in FullCAM</b></p>
<p>The standing dead biomass pools are used to represent slower decomposition of woody biomass that is either standing dead woody biomass (for example following fire or drought) or freshly cut post-clearing or harvesting (for example piled in wind-rows) Such biomass is expected to slowly senesce at breakdown rates that are slower than breakdown rates for debris pools (based on litterbag studies) that have better contact with the soil and organisms that decompose biomass.</p>
<p>In FullCAM, standing dead pools are created through either an assumed initial standing dead pool or through a disturbance event of fire or thinning. When the standing dead pool is created, breakdown properties for these pools must also be set accordingly. Typical values for different events that create standing dead can be found in the most recent annual <a href="http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/climate-science-data/greenhouse-gas-measurement/progress-inventory">National Inventory Report, Volume 2</a>.</p>
<p><b>Breakdown Percentages</b></p>
<p>The breakdown percentage of the standing dead pool is the percentage of the pool that breaks down each year due to the freshly cut or burnt pools of standing dead material slowly senescing.</p>
<p>Breakdown is the process by which standing dead material senesces to becomes a combination of:<p>
<ul>
<li><i>Atmospheric breakdown products</i> - Goes to the atmosphere. Consist mainly of CO2.</li>
<li><i>Solid breakdown products</i> - Goes to the debris pool.</li>
</ul>
<p>The breakdown percentage of a standing dead pool determines how long it takes material to pass through the standing dead pool. Setting a breakdown percentage to 0 means that none of the material in the standing dead pool ever leaves the pool. Setting a high breakdown percentage means that in each simulation step most of the standing dead pool at the beginning of the step moves either to the atmosphere or debris. It assumes exponential decay at a constant decay rate.</p>
<p><b>Atmospheric Percentages of Breakdown Products</b></p>
<p>The atmospheric percentage of the breakdown product of a standing dead pool is the percentage of the breakdown products of the standing dead pool that moves to the atmosphere (the rest moves to the corresponding debris pool).</p>

<p><b>Details</b></p>
<p>FullCAM uses masses for all its calculations, so stem density is only used to convert between stem masses and stem volumes. Stem density is required if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modelling is of a multilayer forest and any of the following:

<ul><li>Tree growth is specified by stem volume increments;</li>
<li>The amount of stem material is specified by volume in the initial conditions; or</li>
<li>The amount of stem material in any tree planting is specified by volume.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>See the <i>Properties of the Species Time Series</i> section of <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/42_Growth Properties.htm" target="_blank">Growth Properties</a>.</p>
<p>If only the trees are modelled, the  plant age used in the stem density time series is the maximum age of the plants (there are no events in this configuration, so the maximum and average ages are the same).</p>
<p>Because the stem density is a time series, it may vary with the age of the tree (set <i>Years are</i> to “Years since plants sprouted”) or with the year (set <i>Years are</i> to “Calendar years” or “Years since start of simulation”).</p>
<p>The stem density is of the whole stem at the time indicated, not of the new stem growth in that year. The units are kilograms per cubic metre (note: most other masses in FullCAM are in tonnes).</p>
<p>The density of stem wood is typically between 300–1,000 kgdm/m<sup>3</sup>. A compendium of wood densities for Australian tree species can be found in the NCAS Technical Report No. 18.</p>
<p>Typical values for native forest communities are described in Table 7 of <i>Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Land Use Change in Australia: An Integrated Application of the National Carbon Accounting System</i>. Additional species specific values can be extracted from the FullCAM database.</p>

        <html><head><title>Mortality</title>
<!--#include file="./incs/header.inc.htm"-->
<p><b>Mortality</b></p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/43_Plant Properties.htm" target="_blank">Plant Properties</a> window : <i>Mortality</i> section]</p>
<p>Specify mortality rates for the plant species.</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>Specify what percentage of plants die, what percentage of the plant components die, and the average age of the plants that die. By specifying the average age of the plants that die, and whether or not new plants replace them, you can control the change in the average age of the plants. This is only of interest if you are using the average age of the plants to determine relative allocations or growth (see the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/42_Growth Properties.htm" target="_blank">Growth Properties</a> window), in which case you can control how mortality moves the plants along their growth curves.</p>
<p>Plant mass that “dies due to mortality” becomes turnover and is treated in all ways as turnover, except that mortality mass is added to turnover after yield-versus-production has been determined. (Yield measurements do include the effects of regular turnover, but do not include the effects of mortality or site biomass limits.)</p>
<p><b>Stem or Stalk Loss</b></p>
<p>Specify the percentages of the plants that die each year in the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/19_Stem Loss and Stalk Loss.htm" target="_blank">Stem Loss and Stalk Loss</a> time series.</p>
<p><b>Ratios of Component Losses to Stem Loss</b></p>
<p>When a given percentage of the stems or stalks die, the percentages of other plant components on the plot that die may be different. Specify these differences in the “Ratio...” fields. For example, if the <i>ratio of leaf loss to stem loss</i> is 0.3 and 2% of the  tree stems die in a given year, then the percentage of leaves on the plot that are lost is only 2% * 0.3 = 0.6% (perhaps the trees close to death have fewer leaves than the other trees?).</p>
<p><b>Effect on Average Age of Plants</b></p>
<p>Specify the average age (in years) of the plants that die by specifying the three coefficients in a formula:</p>
<ol><li>The multiplier for the current average age of the plants (A)</li>
<li>The multiplier for the age of the oldest plants in the forest or crop (B)</li>
<li>An additive constant, in years (C)</li></ol>
<p>The average age of plants that die is</p>
<p><blockquote>A * (average age of plants)  +  B * (age of oldest plants)  + C.</blockquote></p>
<p>If this average age is less than zero or greater than the age of the oldest plants, no plant mortality occurs (that is, no plants die in that step due to “mortality”). This feature allows you to specify, for example,</p>
<ul><li>a constant age of death</li>
<li>a constant mortality in the Stem Loss or Stalk Loss time series and mortality losses will not start until the oldest plants reach the specified average age of death.</li></ul>
<p><b>Example 1</b>. If A = 0, B = 0, C = 50 then the average age of the dying plants is 50 years. Thus there is no plant loss due to mortality unless the age of the oldest plant exceeds 50 years. If the age of the oldest plants is over 50, and the average age of the plants is 40 years and 10% of the plants die, then the average age of the plants that die is 50 years and the average age after mortality is 38.89 years (assuming no replacement).</p>
<p><b>Example 2</b>. If A = 1.2, B = 0, C = –3 then the average age of the dying plants is 20% greater than the average age of plants (before the mortality is taken into account) less three years. So if the average age of the plants was 10 years, then the average age of the dying plants would be 1.2 * 10 – 3 = 9 years.</p>
<p>The average age of the dying plants is only used to calculate the average age of the remaining plants. It is your responsibility to specify the average age of the dying plants sensibly, and so that it interacts properly with the times or ages in the Stem Loss or Stalk Loss time series. If the average age of the plants after mortality is applied is greater than the age of the oldest plants then it is changed to the age of the oldest plants.</p>
<p>The age of the oldest plants is not affected by mortality — it is only altered by planting or clearing events, and the passage of time.</p>
<p><b>Replacement</b></p>
<p>Check the “Replace dying trees” or “Replace dying plants” field if you want new plants to start up from age 0 in the spaces left behind by the dead plants. The only effect of this choice is on the average age of the forest or crop. In a plantation you will usually not check this field (as established trees will expand to fill the space of the dying (removed) trees, intermingled with the retained trees). In a native forest, however, you should check this field (because there is usually a constant regeneration of trees).</p>

<p>This time series specifies plant mortality — the percentage of stems or stalks (and thus plants) that die per year. To make the mortality rate a function of tree age, set the <i>Years are</i> in the <i>Timing</i> panel to <i>Years since plants sprouted</i>.</p>
<p>The type of plant age to use in this time series, if it is expressed in years since the plants sprouted, is chosen in the <i>Properties of the Species Time Series</i> section in the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/42_Growth Properties.htm" target="_blank">Growth Properties</a> window.</p>
<p>The percentages in this time series are limited to less than 100% — use one of the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/136_Events.htm" target="_blank">Events</a> to kill the whole forest or crop.</p>

<p><b>Debris Properties</b></p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/215_Trees.htm" target="_blank">Trees</a> page or <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/216_Crops.htm" target="_blank">Crops</a> page : <i>Properties of the Species</i> panel : <i>Debris</i> button]</p>
<p>Specify the properties of the debris produced by the current species (<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/56_Select a Species.htm" target="_blank">Select a Species</a>). Debris from separate species is treated entirely separately by FullCAM. See the discussion of debris vs. mulch in <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/6_Configure the Plot.htm" target="_blank">Configure the Plot</a>.</p>
<p><b>Resistant Percentages</b></p>
<p>The resistant  percentage of a tree or crop pool is the percentage of the mass of the pool that is resistant to decomposition.</p>
<p>The resistant percentage of a tree or crop pool is the percentage of material that would go into the resistant plant material (RPM) pool rather than the decomposable plant material (DPM) pool. The DPM and RPM definitions are part of the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/114_RothC.htm" target="_blank">RothC</a> model.</p>
<p>The tree or crop material that is not resistant is decomposable. When material from the trees and crops enters the debris, it goes either into either a decomposable or a resistant debris pool.</p>
<p><b>More-Resistant Percentages</b></p>
<p>The more-resistant percentage of a pool of resistant debris is the percentage of the pool that goes to the <i>more-resistant plant mulch</i> pool (the rest of the material entering the mulch goes to the<i> less-resistant plant mulch</i> pool). All the resistant litter pools are assumed to have the same more-resistant percentage, so FullCAM only requires a single more-resistant percentage.</p>
<p><b>Breakdown Percentages</b></p>
<p>The breakdown percentage of a debris pool is the percentage of the pool that breaks down each year.</p>
<p>Breakdown is the process by which debris becomes a combination of:</p>
<ol><li><i>Atmospheric breakdown products</i> - Goes to the atmosphere. Consist mainly of CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
<li><i>Solid breakdown products</i> - Goes to the soil (if mulch is not modelled) or the mulch (if mulch is modelled).</li></ol>
<p>The breakdown percentage of a debris pool determines how long it takes material to pass through the debris pool. Setting a breakdown percentage to 0 means that none of the material in the debris pool ever leaves the pool. Setting a high breakdown percentage means that in each simulation step most of the debris pool at the beginning of the step moves either to the atmosphere, soil, or mulch. It assumes exponential decay at constant decay rate.</p>
<p>The chopped wood pools only have material in them due to a <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/52_Chopper Roller.htm" target="_blank">Chopper Roller</a> event, which can only occur in a forest with no trees.</p>
<p>Typical values for a crop would be for complete breakdown of litter annually. Table 13 of the report <i>Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Land Use Change in Australia: An Integrated Application of the National Carbon Accounting System</i> provides some typical rates for native forests:</p>
<br/>
<p>Litter Decomposition Rates for Tree Components.</p>

<tr><td>Decomposable Leaf</td><td align="center">1.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Resistant Leaf</td><td align="center">1.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Decomposable Deadwood</td><td align="center">0.1</td></tr>

<tr><td>Decomposable Fine Root</td><td align="center">0.3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Resistant Fine Root</td><td align="center">0.4</td></tr></table>
<p><b>Atmospheric Percentages of Breakdown Products</b></p>
<p>The atmospheric percentage of the breakdown product of a debris pool is the percentage of the breakdown products of the debris pool that moves to the atmosphere (the rest moves to the soil or the mulch).</p>

        <html><head><title>Sensitivity of Debris Breakdown to Temperature and Water</title>
<!--#include file="./incs/header.inc.htm"-->
<p><b>Sensitivity of Debris Breakdown to Temperature and Water</b></p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/45_Debris Properties.htm" target="_blank">Debris Properties</a> window : <i>Sensitivity</i> section]</p>
<p>Specify how the breakdown rates of the debris increase with increasing temperature and water.</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>You can choose either of both of two styles of sensitivity:</p>
<p>Mulch style.

<br/><a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/203_Soil.htm" target="_blank">Soil</a> style (as in <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/114_RothC.htm" target="_blank">RothC</a>).</p>
<p>The mulch layer always has temperature and water sensitivity: the mulch decomposition rates increase with increasing temperature and rainfall. Turning on mulch-style sensitivity will cause the debris breakdown layer to behave with mulch-like responses to conditions. Mulch-style sensitivity can be used to provide a more mulch-like simulation, if required.</p>
<p>The soil layer always has temperature and water sensitivity: the soil decomposition rates increase with increasing temperature and decreasing topsoil moisture deficit.</p>
<p>All debris pools are always affected in the same manner. The same sensitivity factor applies to the breakdown rate of each debris pool.</p>
<p><b>No Sensitivity To Temperature or Water</b></p>
<p>If neither style of sensitivity is on, then the fraction of each debris pool lost due to breakdown is equal to the breakdown percentage for the pool (entered elsewhere on the window) adjusted to the relevant period of time:</p>
<p><blockquote><i>g</i> = <i>M * L</i>,</blockquote></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><i>g</i>  = mass of material lost from the pool due to breakdown in the time period</p>
<p><i>M</i> = mass of the pool at the beginning of the time period</p>
<p><i>L</i>  = fraction of mass in the pool at the beginning of the time period that is lost due to breakdown</p>
<p>= 1 – (1 –<i> f</i>)^<i>y</i></p>
<p><i>f</i>   = breakdown fraction (fraction lost due to breakdown per year)</p>
<p>= breakdown percentage of pool / 100</p>
<p><i>y</i>  = number of years in time period.</p>
<p>Note that <i>g</i>, <i>M</i>, and <i>L</i> are independent of temperature and water. 0 &lt;= <i>f</i> &lt;= 1.</p>
<p><b>Mulch-Style Sensitivity</b></p>
<p>If mulch-style sensitivity is on and soil-style sensitivity is off, then you must enter the sensitivity to temperature (<i>s</i>) and the sensitivity to water (<i>v</i>), which determine how sensitive the breakdown rates are.</p>
<p><blockquote><i>g</i> = <i>M * L</i> *  [ 1 – exp(–<i>s * T</i>) ] * [ 1 – exp(–<i>v * W</i>) ]</blockquote></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><i>s</i>   = the sensitivity of breakdown to temperature (<i>s</i> &gt;= 0)</p>
<p><i>T</i>  = the average air temperature (in deg C, negative temperatures treated as zero for this purpose) during the time period (<i>T</i> &gt;= 0),</p>
<p><i>v</i>    =  the sensitivity of breakdown to water (<i>v</i> &gt;= 0)</p>
<p><i>W</i>  =  the total rainfall and irrigation (in mm) during the time period (<i>W</i> &gt;= 0). Notice that both the temperature factor</p>
<p><blockquote>1 – exp(–<i>s * T</i>)</blockquote></p>
<p>and the water factor</p>
<p>1 – exp(–<i>v * W</i>)</p>
<p>are:</p>
<ul><li>Between 0 and 1</li>
<li>Nearer 0 (less breakdown)  as <i>T</i> and <i>W</i> fall or as <i>s</i> and <i>v</i> fall</li>
<li>Nearer 1 (more breakdown) as <i>T</i> and W rise or as <i>s</i> and<i> v</i> rise.</li></ul>
<p>The overall rate of breakdown is quite sensitive to <i>s</i> and <i>v</i>. If <i>s</i> or <i>v</i> are too small then there is almost no breakdown; if <i>s</i> or <i>v</i> are too large then sensitivity is lost. As a very rough guide:</p>
<ul><li>set  <i>s</i>  to about  1 / (average temperature in a simulation step)</li>
<li>set  <i>v</i>  to about  1 / (average rainfall-plus-irrigation during a simulation step).</li></ul>
<p>If mulch-style sensitivity is on, the rate of breakdown falls to zero when the average air temperature is at or below freezing or there is no rainfall or irrigation specified.</p>
<p><b>Soil-Style Sensitivity</b></p>
<p>This option is only possible when the soil is modelled, because it uses the topsoil moisture deficit in the soil and various RothC soil inputs to compute the rate of breakdown. If it is on then it will cause a difference to aboveground results when the soil is and is not included in the model — because if the soil is included in the model then this sensitivity is on but if the soil is not included then this sensitivity is off.</p>
<p>If soil-style sensitivity is on and mulch-style sensitivity is off, then you do not need to enter any inputs: FullCAM uses the sensitivity defined in the soil model (<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/114_RothC.htm" target="_blank">RothC</a>), which does not have any inputs exposed in the user-interface.</p>
<p><blockquote><i>g</i> = <i>M</i> * <i>L</i>,</blockquote></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><i>L</i>  = fraction of mass in the pool at the beginning of the time period that is lost due to breakdown</p>
<p><blockquote>= 1 – (1 – <i>f</i>)^(<i>y</i> * <i>a</i> * <i>b</i>)</blockquote></p>
<p><i>a</i>  = rate modifier due to temperature</p>
<p>= 47.91 / (1 + exp0(106.06 / (18.27 + <i>T</i>))  for <i>T</i>  &gt;  –5</p>
<p>0 for <i>T</i> &lt;= –5</p>
<p><i>b</i>  = rate modifier due to water</p>
<p>= 0.2 + 0.8 * (<i>e</i> – TSMD) / (<i>h</i> * [(20 + 130 * <i>c</i> – 100 * <i>c * c</i>) * (<i>d</i> / 23)])</p>
<p>if version 26.3 of RothC in use</p>
<p>1 / (1 + exp[ (TSMD – (0.688405334 + 4.4746369 * <i>c</i> – 3.44203 * <i>c * c</i>) * <i>d</i>)</p>
<p>  	/ ((0.082530817 + 0.5364083 * <i>c</i> – 0.41268 * <i>c * c</i>) * <i>d</i>) ]</p>
<p>if version 26.5 of RothC in use</p>
<p><i>c</i> = clay fraction of soil</p>
<p><i>d</i> = sample depth of soil</p>
<p><i>h</i>  = Ratio of the maximum TSMD when soil is bare to the maximum TSMD when soil is covered</p>
<p>TSMD = topsoil moisture deficit (as computed by RothC).</p>
<p>Increasing <i>a</i> or <i>b</i> increases the effective time of decomposition, or effectively increases the rate of decomposition during a given time period. Increasing <i>T</i> or <i>W</i> increases <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> respectively (increasing <i>W</i> tends to increase the TSMD). 0 &lt;= <i>a</i> &lt;= 1 and  0 &lt;= <i>b</i> &lt;= 1.</p>
<p><b>Combined Mulch-Style and Soil-Style Sensitivity</b></p>
<p>If soil-style sensitivity and mulch-style sensitivity are both on then FullCAM combines both styles of sensitivity.</p>
<p><i>g</i> = <i>M * L</i> *  [ 1 – exp(–<i>s * T</i>) ] * [ 1 – exp(–<i>v * W</i>) ],</p>
<p>where</p>
<p><i>L</i>  = 1 – (1 – <i>f</i>)^(<i>y</i> * <i>a * b</i>)</p>

<p><b>Product Properties</b></p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/215_Trees.htm" target="_blank">Trees</a> page or <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/216_Crops.htm" target="_blank">Crops</a> page : <i>Properties of the Species</i> panel : <i>Products</i> button]</p>

<p><i>Products</i> are any plant material that is moved offsite from the plot. Products from separate species is treated entirely separately by FullCAM.</p>
<p><b>Decomposition Percentages</b></p>
<p>The decomposition percentage of a product pool (either “in use” or “in landfill”) is the average percentage of carbon mass lost to decomposition (and thus as CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere) each year. The higher the decomposition percentage, the faster the product returns its carbon to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>A decomposition percentage of 0 means that none of the pool decomposes (so no carbon returns to the atmosphere from the product). A decomposition percentage of 100% means that in each simulation step all of the pool decomposes, thereby returning all of its carbon to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The decomposition percentage of a debris pool is the percentage lost per year due to decomposition (that is, 100% less the percentage of the original material that is still there a year later, if decomposition is the only process removing material from the pool). It assumes exponential decay at constant decay rate. Click the exponential decay button for alternative expressions, a graph, and a fuller explanation.</p>
<p><b>Bio-energy, Move-to-Landfill</b></p>
<p>Forest products may be burnt for bio-energy or moved to landfill after being used.</p>
<p>Once in a landfill, material just decomposes Ś thereby returning its carbon to the atmosphere eventually. For a given species and product type, the decomposition percentage for a product in use will generally be higher than the decomposition percentage for the product in landfill. Agricultural products may be burnt for bio-energy after being used, but may not be moved to a landfill.</p>
<p>Material burnt for bio-energy is burnt immediately (it is NOT added to the biofuel), thereby returning its carbon to the atmosphere. The “biofuel” product category is there for a different purpose: the biofuel product pool consists of biofuel stocks awaiting burning for bio-energy. Setting the <i>Percentage Burnt for Bio-Energy Each Year</i> to 100% causes all the biofuel in the pool at the beginning of a simulation step to be burnt in that step. For completeness, you have the option of sending forest biofuel to landfill instead of burning it for bio-energy.</p>
<p><b>Product Categories</b></p>
<p>The names of the wood products here do NOT define the products: the behaviour of the various wood product categories are defined solely by the product decomposition fractions. The only things of significance to FullCAM are that a hectare of forest produces X tonnes of a wood product that decomposes at a given rate, and so on.</p>
<p>Suppose a forest product is being used to produce fence palings for suburban back yards. There is no category here called “fence palings”. The only thing relevant to carbon accounting is how fast those fence palings decompose. Suppose you find that 1/20 of the carbon in the fence palings returns to the atmosphere each year. Then the decomposition percentage of the fence palings is 5%. Make sure that one of the wood product decomposition fractions is about 5%, and add the fence palings to that category. For instance, suppose you enter the decomposition rate of packing wood as 5.2%. Add the fence palings to the category labelled “packing wood”.</p>
<p>The 0.2% difference in decomposition rate may be negligible but if not allocate your decomposition rates as best as possible.</p>
<p>The wood product names used here are suggestive only (terms such as “very long lived wood”, “long lived wood”, ..., “short lived wood” or may be “wood life 7”, ..., “wood life 1” could also have been used.</p>
<p>Crop product names can be taken more literally, but the same applies as with the wood products Ś the names do not matter per se, as only the decomposition fractions define the behaviour of the plant products for carbon accounting purposes.</p>
<p>The rationale behind the wood products life cycle pools used by the NCAS can be found in the NCAS Technical Reports <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/./reps/TR8 Usage and Life Cycle of Wood Products.pdf" target="_blank">No. 8</a> and <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/./reps/TR24 Analysis of Wood Product Accounting Options for the National Carbon Accounting System.pdf" target="_blank">No. 24</a> (<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/190_Contact Us.htm" target="_blank">Contact Us</a>).</p>

<p>The standard events are simply events which are made available for a species for convenience. The standard events downloaded through Data Builder are only available for convenience and may not be relevant or applicable for the particular species of interest. The standard events should not be confused with the event queue (on the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/136_Events.htm" target="_blank">Events</a> page). The event queue is the queue of events that will be simulated during a plot simulation.</p>
<p><b>Uses</b></p>
<ol><li>If you often use a particular event on the <i>Events</i> page, you might want to store the event as a standard event. Then, when you want another such event on the <i>Events</i> page, you can load the input values from the standard event rather than retyping them. Also, storing the events that are typical for a given species is helpful when you give the species to others.</li>

<p>Specify the material that enters the soil. See the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/114_RothC.htm" target="_blank">RothC</a> soil pool abbreviations.</p>
<p><b>Soil Input Percentages of Humified Mulch</b></p>
<p>Specify where the humified mulch goes to within the active soil. FullCAM only includes mulch if you have configured <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/109_GENDEC.htm" target="_blank">GENDEC</a> to model the mulch, and this section is only on if RothC models the active soil.</p>
<p>With such a configuration, each pool in the mulch undergoes humification, the process whereby material is transported from the mulch down to the soil. This material, the humified mulch, can enter the DPM, RPM or HUM pools within the soil. Specify, for each mulch pool, which of these soil pools the humified mulch enters.</p>
<p>Humified mulch from the soluble mulch pools, being decomposable, can only go to the DPM or HUM pools. Humified mulch from the more-resistant and less-resistant mulch pools, being resistant , can only go to the RPM or HUM pools. Humified mulch from the live microbes pools contains both decomposable and resistant material, so specify the percentage that goes to DPM and RPM versus HUM.</p>
<p>Naturally, the sum of each pair of percentages is 100%. Therefore the HUM percentage is calculated automatically from the DPM/RPM value.</p>
<p><b>Typical values used are:</b></p>
<table><tr><th>Variable</th><th>To DPM or RPM</th><th>To HUM</th></tr>
<tr><td>Plant Soluble litter</td><td align="center">100</td><td align="center">0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Plant Less Resistant</td><td align="center">80</td><td align="center">20</td></tr>

<tr><td>Microbial More Resistant </td><td align="center">40</td><td align="center">60</td></tr>
<tr><td>Live Microbes</td><td align="center">75</td><td align="center">25</td></tr></table>
<p><b>Soil Input Percentages of Broken-Down Litter</b></p>
<p>Specify where the broken-down litter goes to within the active soil.</p>
<p>The material in each litter pool breaks down, thereby transporting material from the litter to the soil. This material, the broken-down litter, can enter the DPM, RPM or HUM pools within the soil. Here, you specify, for each type of broken down litter, which of these soil pools the broken-down litter enters.</p>
<p>The decomposable and resistant broken-down litter always goes to either the DPM, RPM or HUM.</p>
<p>Naturally, the sum of each pair of percentages is 100%. Therefore the HUM percentage is calculated automatically from the DPM/RPM value.</p>
<p><b>Typical values used are:</b></p>
<table><tr><th>Variable</th><th>To DPM or RPM</th><th>To HUM</th></tr>
<tr><td>Decomposable Litter</td><td align="center">90</td><td align="center">10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Resistant Litter</td><td align="center">90</td><td align="center">10</td></tr></table>
<p><b>Manure from Offsite</b></p>
<p>Manure from offsite (from outside the plot) may be added to the forest or agricultural soil. Offsite manure inputs are only available if RothC is used to model the soil.</p>
<p>Enter the time series of manure carbon additions or add manure application events to the ‘Events’ tab depending on how manure additions were configured in the ‘Events’ or time series window of the ‘Configuration tab’</p>
<p>Manure from offsite may be added to the forest or agricultural soil. Enter the carbon mass in the manure, in tonnes per hectare, over time.</p>
<p>‘Offsite’ means ‘from outside the plot’. Offsite manure inputs are only available if Roth-C is used to model the soil.</p>
<p>In an agricultural system, manure from animals on the plot is dealt with by grazing events (plant material eaten by grazing animals becomes fodder, which may move to destinations including the DPM an RPM pools of the soil). The offsite manure is the only explicit treatment of manure by FullCAM.</p>
<p>Specify the percentages of the carbon in any offsite manure added to the soil that move to the various organic soil components. The percentages add to 100%; the HUM percentage is automatically calculated from the others.</p>
<p>Note that manure from offsite and grazing are entirely separate. The manure inputs entered here have no effect on any grazing manure, and vice versa.</p>
<p><b>Typical values used are:</b></p>
<table><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Percentage of Manure</th></tr>
<tr><td>DPM</td><td align="center">49</td></tr>
<tr><td>RPM</td><td align="center">49</td></tr>
<tr><td>BIO-F</td><td align="center">0</td></tr>
<tr><td>BIO-S</td><td align="center">0</td></tr></table>
<p><b>Plant Residues</b></p>
<p>Plant residue inputs are plant material from the debris or mulch that enters the soil. The material enters the DPM soil pool if it is decomposable, or the RPM soil pool if it is resistant. Specify the total amount of plant material entering the soil over time.</p>
<p>Plant residues can only be specified here if you are simulating the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/203_Soil.htm" target="_blank">Soil</a> by itself. If you are simulating a multilayer system, then the plant residues from the debris or mulch are automatically calculated, so an explicit input for plant residues is neither required nor desired.</p>
<p>The ratio of DPM to RPM is the mass of DPM divided by the mass of RPM in the plant matter added to the soil, and is also known as the “quality factor for incoming plant debris”. Typical values for the ratio of DPM to RPM are:</p>
<p>1.44 - Most agricultural crops and improved grassland

<br/>0.67 - Unimproved grassland and scrub (including savanna)

<br/>0.25 - Deciduous and tropical woodland.</p>

<!--#include file="./incs/header.inc.htm"-->
<p><b>Soil Properties</b></p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/203_Soil.htm" target="_blank">Soil</a> page : <i>Forest</i> or <i>Agricultural</i>  panel : <i>Properties</i> button]</p>
<p>Enter the general properties of the soil. See the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/114_RothC.htm" target="_blank">RothC</a> soil pool abbreviations.</p>
<p><b>Assorted</b></p>
<p>The <i>HUM encapsulation percentage</i> is the percentage of the HUM carbon mass that is encapsulated by clay, and thus becomes inert, each year. Encapsulation transfers carbon to the inert pool. The HUM encapsulation percentage is defaulted to zero.</p>
<p>The <i>depth of soil sampled</i> is the maximum soil depth that is being modelled, typically to 30 cm. Soil above the sample depth is considered shallow and topsoil.</p>
<p><b>Decomposition Rate Multipliers</b></p>
<p>The quantity of carbon in each <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/114_RothC.htm" target="_blank">RothC</a> soil pool (DPM, RPM, BIO-F, BIO-S, HUM) decays exponentially with time if there is no new carbon flowing into the pool: After a time<i> t</i> (in years), the fraction of the original carbon still in the pool is</p>
<blockquote><p style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-size:large;">y</span> = <span style="font-size:large">x</span> <sup>(–<i>abct</i>)</sup></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><i>a</i> = rate modifier for temperature

<br/><i> b</i> = rate modifier for topsoil moisture

<br/><i>c</i> = rate modifier for soil cover

<br/><i>k</i> = decomposition rate multiplier [1/y].</p></blockquote>
<p><i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> are the same for all pools, but <i>k</i> can be different for different pools.</p>
<p>In a step of <i>T</i> years (<i>T</i> &lt;= 1), the fraction of the carbon that is in the pool at the beginning of the step and that leaves the pool during the step (the “decomposition fraction” of the pool for that step) is thus</p>
<blockquote><p style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-size:large;">y</span> = <span style="font-size:large">x</span> <sup>(–<i>abckT</i>)</sup></p>
<p>Typically, the decomposition rate multipliers are approximately:</p>
<p><i>k</i><p><table>
<tr><td>10.00</td><td>DPM</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.30</td><td>RPM</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.66</td><td>BIO-F (only entered in version 26.3 of RothC)</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.66</td><td>BIO-S (only entered in version 26.3 of RothC)</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.02</td><td>HUM</td></tr>
</table></p></p></blockquote>
<p>In version 26.5 of RothC: The BIO-F and BIO-S decomposition rate multipliers when the soil is bare are computed for you by RothC. When the soil is covered, both of these multipliers are further multiplied by the <i>BIO-F and BIO-S modifier</i>, which is typically about 3.25. Note that the forest soil is always covered, but covering of the agricultural soil depends whether a crop or pasture exists.</p>
<p><b>Plant Material, Biomass, and Humus Destination Percentages</b></p>
<p>This window is for any material in the active soil pools that undergoes decomposition. In each step of the simulation, material moves to the various active soil carbon pools and to the atmosphere. The fraction of moving material that leaves the soil for the atmosphere as gas is computed by a RothC formula from the clay content of the soil (a higher clay content means that a lower fraction leaves as gas). The remainder of the moving material, called the “solids”, moves to another or the same active soil pool.</p>
<p>Moving material that is not given off as gas moves to the BIO-F, BIO-S and HUM pools. The percentages moving to these pools are the same for each of the plant material (DPM and RPM) and biomass (BIO-F and BIO-S) pools. In version 26.3 of RothC, no material moves from the plant material or biomass pools to the BIO-S pool, or from the HUM pool to the BIO-F pool. The destination percentages add to 100%; the HUM percentage is automatically calculated from the other(s).</p>

<p><b>Ratio of Evapotranspiration to Open-Pan Evaporation</b></p>
<p>The <i>Ratio of evapotranspiration to open-pan evaporation</i> is the ratio of water lost through evapotranspiration (in mm) to water lost by open-pan evaporation (in mm).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/114_RothC.htm" target="_blank">RothC</a> uses rainfall and evapotranspiration to calculate the topsoil moisture deficit (TSMD), which is difficult to measure. They calculate the evapotranspiration as the product of the open-pan evaporation (which is easy to measure) and this ratio. This ratio is 0.75 for temperate soils.</p>
<p>Alternatively, obtain monthly evapotranspiration with adequate accuracy from Muller’s (1982) collection of meteorological data for sites around the world, then enter the evapotranspiration data in the open-pan evaporation time series and set this ratio to one.</p>
<p><b>Ratio of Bare-to-Covered Maximum TSMD</b></p>
<p>The <i>ratio of maximum TSMD for bare soil to maximum TSMD for covered soil</i> is the ratio of the maximum topsoil moisture deficit (TSMD) for bare soil to the maximum TSMD for covered soil.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/135_time-series window.htm" target="_blank">Time Series Window</a> is where you specify whether or not the agricultural soil is covered, in plot models that only model the agricultural soil (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/6_Configure the Plot.htm" target="_blank">Configure the Plot</a>).</p>
<p><b>Agricultural Soil</b></p>
<p>The soil cover factor is a rate modifier applied against soil decay as computed by the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/114_RothC.htm" target="_blank">RothC</a> model. It is set as covered (default value of 0.6) when a plant exists, slowing down decay. When a plot is uncovered the value is set to 1, speeding up decay.</p>
<p>When the soil cover is automatically calculated by FullCAM as part of a multilayer agricultural system, the agricultural soil is considered to be always covered except after clearing events where crop and pasture is fully removed.



<p>If you are modelling the soil but not the whole agricultural system, then you have to tell FullCAM when the soil is covered or not. Soil cover consists of debris and plants, and it affects the rate of moisture loss from the soil and thus the agricultural soil water levels.</p>
<p>Enter the soil cover time series to tell FullCAM when there is enough soil cover to slow down the rate of water loss from the soil. If the agricultural soil is covered by vegetation or debris (and thus less prone to drying out) for the whole of the relevant period, then enter 1. If it is bare for the whole period, enter 0. If it is partly covered for all of the period, or covered for only part of the period, enter a number between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>After interpolation and extrapolation to get a soil cover value in each simulation step, a soil cover value of 0.5 or greater is treated as covered and a soil over value of less than 0.5 is treated as bare.</p>
<p><b>Forest Soil</b></p>

<p><b>Bulk Density</b></p>
<p>Soil consists of:</p>
<ul><li>Particles — either clay or quartz (in this context “quartz” just means “not-clay”)</li>
<li>Pore space —  the voids between the particles, usually filled with air or water.</li></ul>
<p>The bulk density of the soil is the particle mass divided by its bulk volume, where the bulk volume is the volume of the particles and pores together in soil. Thus the bulk density is just the density of the soil as it exists in the ground, treated as a bulk object (that is, a solid object where we ignore the tiny holes / pores, so its boundary is as we would normally see it from a couple of meters away). Units: tonnes per cubic meter.</p>
<p>Used to compute the amount of water required to saturate the shallow soil (namely the mm of water added from the point at which the TSMD is zero until draining starts to occur), that is, the total porosity of the soil expressed in mm of water.</p>
<p>By the way:</p>
<table><tr><td>Porosity</td><td>= pore space / bulk volume  [a fraction]</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>=  (bulk volume - particle volume) / bulk volume</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>= 1 - [ particle volume * particle mass) / (bulk volume * particle mass) ]</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>= 1 - (bulk density) / (particle mass / particle volume)</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>= 1 - (bulk density) / (particle density)</td></tr>
<tr><td>WFPS</td><td>= water filled pore space fraction</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>= water-filled-pore-space / total-pore-space [a fraction]</td></tr></table>
<p>Water is always measured in mm of clear water, a 1-D measurement that suffices for volumes in soils.</p>

<p>If the selection is as a percentage of maximum tree biomass, then the initial conditions for the forest will be set at their site maximum scaled to the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/206_Forest Percentage.htm" target="_blank">Forest Percentage</a>. Bear in mind that trees will still grow relative to their age, and so this option should generally only be used when modelling the removal of forest at the start of the simulation.</p>
<p>If the selection is as a percentage of tree-age biomass, then the intial conditions for the forest will be set as a proportion of their site maximum based on the age profile of the trees, and scaled to the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/206_Forest Percentage.htm" target="_blank">Forest Percentage</a>.  This is the recommended choice for modelling a forest in most circumstances and is used by the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/132_Data Builder.htm" target="_blank">Data Builder</a>.</p>
<p><b>Masses</b></p>
<p>Available when specifying tree size by mass or volume.</p>
<p>The masses of the various tree components at the start of the simulation, in tonnes of dry matter per hectare. Note that these are true masses, not carbon masses as in some other inputs.</p>
<p><b>Volumes</b></p>
<p>Available when specifying tree size by volume for stems.</p>
<p>The stem volume is the total volume of stems in the forest, in cubic meters per hectare. This volume will be converted to a mass in the FullCAM simulation by multiplying it by the stem density.</p>
<p><b>Percentage of biomass</b></p>
<p>Available when specifying tree size by percentages of maximum biomass or tree-age biomass</p>
<p>The proportions of biomass in each pool are determined here.  The resulting biomass and carbon in each pool is calculated relative to the Site <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/36_Site_Maximum Aboveground Biomass.htm" target="_blank">Maximum Aboveground Biomass</a>, and if selecting tree-age biomass then the Age.</p>
<p><b>Ages</b></p>
<p>Tree ages are used to access the tree time series.</p>
<p>The age of the oldest trees in the forest is the age of the forest. The average age of the trees in the forest reflects the new trees that are assumed to have grown after removal of tree stems in past thinnings. The average tree age must be less than the age of the oldest trees.</p>
<p>Unless there are thinning events that thin some but not all of the tree stems, the age of the oldest trees will equal the average age of the trees.  Setting both ages to a very large number will approximate maturity.</p>

The species on the menu are those on the <i>Crops</i> page. The menu contains only a blank line if there are no crop species, in which case you need to create a new species on the <i>Crops</i> page.</p>
<p>The initial crop species is the (only) species of any crop plants growing in the agricultural system. Also, any debris in the agricultural system, or any agricultural products in use or in the landfill, are assumed to belong to that species.</p>

<p>Specify whether there is a crop of plants growing in the agricultural system at the beginning of the simulation. If there is not, then the agricultural system is clear and the other inputs need not be entered.</p>
<p><b>Ages</b></p>
<p>Crop ages are used to access the crop time series.</p>
<p>The age of the oldest plants in the crop is the age of the crop — the number of years since the current crop was planted, plus the age of the plants when they were planted.</p>
<p>The average age of the plants in the crop reflects the new plants that are assumed to have grown after removal of plants in any past partial harvestings. The average plant age must be less than the age of the oldest plants.</p>

<p>Describe the debris present in the plot at the start of the simulation.</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>All of the initial forest debris belongs to the initial tree species, which is specified in the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/185_Initial Trees.htm" target="_blank">Initial Trees</a> window.</p>

<p>If different species are planted later in the simulation, the debris of each species is treated separately because each species may have different breakdown rates (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/45_Debris Properties.htm" target="_blank">Debris Properties</a>).</p>
<p><b>Carbon Masses</b></p>
<p>Enter the mass of carbon in the various debris pools, in tonnes per hectare.</p>
<p>Debris is classified as either <i>decomposable</i> or <i>resistant</i>, which is an indication of how resistant it is to decay in the soil. Decomposable debris becomes decomposable plant matter (DPM) in the soil after it breaks down, while the resistant debris becomes resistant plant matter (RPM). The DPM and RPM categories are defined by the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/114_RothC.htm" target="_blank">RothC</a> model. Decomposable debris decays more easily than resistant plant material in the soil.</p>
<p>The “decomposable deadwood” carbon mass is the mass of carbon in the decomposable deadwood that is “debris” but not yet “soil” or “mulch”, and so on.</p>
<p>The “chopped wood” pools only have material in them due to a <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/52_Chopper Roller.htm" target="_blank">Chopper Roller</a> event, which can only occur in a forest with no trees.</p>

<p>Describe the standing dead biomass pool present in the plot at the start of the simulation.</p>
<p>The standing dead biomass pools are used to represent slower decomposition of woody biomass that is either standing dead woody biomass (for example following fire or drought) or freshly cut post-clearing or harvesting (for example piled in wind-rows). Such biomass is expected to slowly senesce at breakdown rates that are slower than breakdown rates for debris pools (based on litterbag studies) that have better contact with the soil and organisms that decompose biomass.</p>
<p>Standing dead pools turnover into debris (with some loss as carbon dioxide) rather than turnover into soil as per debris pools (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/285_StandingDead.htm" target="_blank">Standing Dead</a>).<p>

<p><b>Carbon Masses</b></p>
<p>Enter the mass of carbon in the various soil pools, in tonnes per hectare as a time series.</p>
<p><b>Water</b></p>
<p>The topsoil moisture deficit (TSMD) is the amount of rainfall, in mm, required to saturate the topsoil with water. It is a moisture <i>deficit</i>, so the number you enter is zero or positive. The TSMD is used by RothC to simulate soil decomposition.</p>
<p>The available soil water (ASW) is the amount of water available to the trees, in mm, to rooting depth. It is used by <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/115_3PG.htm" target="_blank">3PG</a> to simulate tree growth and by 3PG-lite to compute the forest productivity index (FPI).</p>
<p>FullCAM uses the two forest water balances, TSMD and ASW, separately and simultaneously.</p>
<p>In an agricultural system FullCAM only uses the TSMD, but the agricultural TSMD and the forest water balances (TSMD and ASW) are completely unconnected.</p>

<p>If different species are planted later in the simulation, the products of each species are treated separately because each species may have different product decomposition rates (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/47_Product Properties.htm" target="_blank">Product Properties</a>).</p>
<p>Forest products can start the simulation either in use as products or in the landfill. Agricultural products can only start the simulation in use as products (in FullCAM, agricultural products cannot go to landfill).</p>
<p><b>Carbon Masses</b></p>
<p>Enter the mass of carbon in the various product pools, in tonnes per hectare as a time series.</p>
<p>The names of the products are only indicative: the various product categories are effectively defined by their decomposition fractions (entered as species inputs). All CAMFor cares about is that a hectare of plot produces X tonnes of a product that decomposes at a given rate.</p>
<p>Suppose the plot is a forest that produces fence palings for suburban back yards. There is no category here called “fence palings”. The only thing that matters to carbon accounting is how fast those fence palings decompose. Suppose you find that 1/20 of the carbon in the fence palings returns to the atmosphere each year. Then the decomposition fraction of the fence palings is 0.05 / year. Make sure that one of the wood product decomposition fractions is 0.05 / year, and add the fence palings to that category.</p>

<p><b>Events</b></p>
<p>[<i>Events</i> page of the input window of a plot document]</p>
<p>This page shows the regimes and events that can occur during a simulation.</p>
<p>Each simulation step consists of continuous processes (such as growth or decomposition) punctuated by any events that occur during that step — see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/58_Processes and Events.htm" target="_blank">Processes and Events</a>.</p>
<p><b>Regime and Event Queue</b></p>
<p>The regimes and their associated events are presented on the page in two lists – with one regime or event per line.</p>
<p>To view or edit an individual regime or event, open it by double-clicking on it or selecting it then pressing the <i>Edit</i> button. In the Event window you can click the list section headers to sort the queue by that column.</p>
<p>The sequence of events that occur during the simulation is called the <i>event queue</i>. If the list of events is sorted by time, then the simulating events on the list, in the order presented, constitute the event queue. The terms “event list” and “event queue” are used interchangeably.</p>
<table><tr><th>Event Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Forest</td><td>Only affects the forest system, such as plant trees, forest fire</td></tr>
<tr><td>Agricultural</td><td>Only affects the agricultural system, such as plant crops, harvest</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mixed</td><td>Affects both the forest and agricultural systems, such as forest fraction change</td></tr></table>
<p><b>Populating the Regime and Event Lists</b></p>
<p>Regimes and Events are loaded into their lists by one of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Cloning</i> an existing item (event or regime)</li>
<li>Using the <i>New Regime / Event</i> buttons</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Simulating Events</b></p>
<p>An event is <i>simulating</i> if it will occur in a simulation. All events are simulating, except:</p>
<ul><li>Events that occur outside the period of the simulation (too early or too late)</li>

<table><tr><th>colour</th><th>Method</th></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="Snow">White</td><td>Calendar time (such as 1995 day 24)</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="lightcyan">Light blue</td><td>Time since start of simulation (such as 3 years 24 days)</td></tr></table>
<p>The names on the event list are colour coded to indicate whether they are ready, whether they are simulating or not, and what system they affect:</p>
<table><tr><th>colour</th><th>Status / System</th></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="red">Red</td><td>Event not ready  (renders event queue not ready)</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="Gainsboro">Grey</td><td>Event non-simulating (outside simulation period, will not affect simulation)</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="green">Green</td><td>Forest</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="LemonChiffon">Yellow</td><td>Agricultural</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="BurlyWood">Brown</td><td>Mixed</td></tr></table>
<p>Selected Events and Regimes are coloured in <span style="background-color:lightcyan">light blue</span>.</p>
<p><b>Event Queue and Readiness</b></p>
<p>If the event queue is not ready then the “Events” title on the tab of the <i>Events</i> page is shown in red. Some event queues are not ready because they do not make sense — such as a tree planting when there are already trees, or a tree thin when there are no trees. The first event that causes the event queue to be unready is highlighted in red, and the “Status” box describes the state of the event queue to help you sort out any problems. You are responsible for entering a sequence of events that is valid (that is, such that FullCAM considers that the event queue is ready).</p>
<p><b>Clearing Events</b></p>
<p>A <i>clearing</i> event is one that clears a system (forest or agricultural) of all plants. Depending on their extent, thins, harvests, fires, ploughs and herbicides might be clearing. Generally an event must clear 100% of a plot to be deemed a clearing event. Once a system is cleared, it needs to be planted before there is any more plant growth.</p>

<p><b>Event Timing</b></p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/137_Event Window.htm" target="_blank">Event Window</a> (via the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/136_Events.htm" target="_blank">Events</a> page): <i>Timing</i> panel]</p>
<p>Enter timing information for the event.</p>
<p><b>“Simulate” Checkbox</b></p>
<p>The<i> Simulate</i> checkbox specifies whether or not the event is to be simulated. Uncheck this box to effectively turn the event off — it will still be on the event queue, but it will not be simulated (it will have no effect on a simulation). This is useful for temporarily suspending an event from the simulation.</p>
<p>The <i>Simulate</i> checkbox may be checked or unchecked on the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/137_Event Window.htm" target="_blank">Event Window</a>, or on the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/136_Events.htm" target="_blank">Events</a> page by the secondary mouse button and selecting either <i>Simulate Events</i> or <i>Do Not Simulate Events</i>.</p>
<p><b>Type and Time</b></p>
<p>Specify the event time, as either a:</p>
<p>1.  Calendar date

<br/>Examples: 1 Jan 2001, 31 Dec 2010.</p>
<p>Enter the date in any unambiguous way, such as “4 Sep 2010”, “s4”, “au9 1999”, “4s2000”, “8/4/0” or “8.4.1999”, except that you cannot use hyphens because they are interpreted as negative signs (for example 8 4 -35 is 8 Apr -35).</p>
<p>2. Calendar years and days since the start of the simulation

<br/>Example: -10, 0, 2345.</p>
<p>A calendar year is from a date in one year to the same date in the next year, and can contain either 365 or 366 days depending on leap years. The number of days can also be huge. So if you mean the same date in two years time, set the calendar years equal to two and the days to zero, but if you mean exactly 730 days then set the calendar years to zero and the days to 730.</p>
<p>Changes made in one format are reflected in the other upon format change.</p>
<p>An event always occurs at noon of the day on which it is specified to occur, even if that time is in the middle of a simulation step. FullCAM computes the continuous processes for the partial step up to the event, executes the event, then computes the continuous processes up to the next event or the end of the step.</p>
<p>Each event occurs instantaneously — it begins and ends at noon of the same day.</p>
<p>Event timing may be updated for multiple events by multi-selecting the events on the Event List, and then selecting the right mouse option <i>Apply Offset to Events</i>.  The timing may then be updated by the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/248_Event Update.htm" target="_blank">Event Update</a> dialog.</p>
<p><b>Add Days</b></p>
<p>A offset may be applied to an event by entering a value in the <i>Days</i> field and clicking <i>Add Days</i> button. This can be either positive or negative and will move the event that number of days forward or back in the event queue.</p>

<p>This section of the Events page shows the regimes that can occur during a simulation.</p>
<p>Each Regime step is composed of multiple simulation steps composed of continuous Events (such as planting or harvesting) - see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/58_Processes%20and%20Events.htm" target="_blank">Processes and Events</a>.</p>
<p><b>Populating the Regime List</b></p>
<p>Regimes are loaded into the list by one of four methods:

<p><b>Timing</b></p>
<p>Specify the regime time, as either:

<ol type="1">
<li>. Calendar date<br/>

Examples: 1 Jan 2001, 31 Dec 2010.

<p>Enter the date in any unambiguous way, such as “4 Sep 2010”, “s4”, “au9 1999”, “4s2000”, “8/4/0” or “8.4.1999”, except that you cannot use hyphens because they are interpreted as negative signs (for example 8 4 -35 is 8 Apr -35).</p>
</li>
<li>Calendar years and days since the start of the simulation<br/>

  </li>
</ol>
<p>A calendar year is from a date in one year to the same date in the next year, and can contain either 365 or 366 days depending on leap years. For exmplae, to set a  two year calendar time period, set the calendar years equal to two and the days to zero. For exactly 730 days then set the calendar years to zero and the days to 730.</p>
<p>Changes in one date type are reflected in the other.</p>
<p>An event always occurs at midnight of the day on which it is specified to occur, even if that time is in the middle of a simulation step. FullCAM computes the continuous processes for the partial step up to the event, executes it, then computes the continuous processes up to the next event or the end of the step.</p>
<p>Each event occurs instantaneously - it begins and ends at midnight of the same day.</p>
<p><b>Add Days</b></p>
<p>A offset may be applied to an event by entering a value in the <i>Days</i> field and clicking <i>Add Days</i> button. This can be either positive or negative and will move the event that number of days forward or back in the event queue.<p>

<p><b>Thin</b></p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/137_Event Window.htm" target="_blank">Event Window</a> : <i>Thin</i> panel]</p>
<p>A thin event is where some or all of the forest is harvested.</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The agricultural counterpart of a thin is a <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/153_Harvest.htm" target="_blank">Harvest</a> event</p>
<p>A thin is the only event that creates forest products, taking tree material offsite. See the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/47_Product Properties.htm" target="_blank">Product Properties</a> of each species.</p>
<p><b>Affected Portion</b></p>
<p>The <i>affected portion</i> is the fraction of the total forest area being modelled in which the thin takes place. It is also the fraction of the plot area that is thinned Ś the proportion of an unspecified areas to be reported on a per hectare basis. For most plantations this would generally equate to the fraction of the proportion of trees that are thinned.</p>
<p><b>Destination Percentages in the Affected Portion</b></p>
<p>These destination percentages are applied to the portion of the forest that is affected by the thin.</p>
<p>The destination percentages of litter (deadwood, chopped wood, bark litter, and leaf litter) apply to all species whose material is present in the litter.</p>
<p><b><i>Log Grades</i></b></p>
<p>Specify the percentages of full log grade extractions, which are specified in turn for the species on the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/263_Log Grades or Crop Grades.htm" target="_blank">Log Grades or Crop Grades</a> page.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>specifying 50% of grade 1 means applying a Grade 1 thin  at 50% intensity.

<br/>specifying 100% of grade 3 and 0% for the other grades applies a grade 3 thinning.</p>
<p>You can mix and match, so long as the log grade percentages do not exceed 100%. So if grade 1 took stems for construction and grade 2 was mainly branches for pulp, you could do some of each in this thin.</p>
<p>The <i>Extra Percentages to Debris</i> are for moving material from the plants to the debris independently of (and in addition to) the log grade movements. Especially useful for management operations like pruning. The total plant material moved to the debris is equal to the amounts specified by the log grades, plus the extra movements specified here. The extra amount moved to the debris (above and beyond that specified by the log grades) is equal to or less than the extra amount specified here (depending on whether or not the specified material is available after the log grades).</p>
<p>Check the <i>Clear all remaining tree mass to debris</i> box for this to become a clearing thin (all tree material not specified by the log grades is moved into debris).</p>
<p>Click <i>Show Destinations Percentages...</i> to see all the log grades for the species, and the affect of the specified log grade percentages. You can see the destination percentages for the affected forest, which are equivalent of the manual percentage changes (see next).</p>
<p>The advantage of the log grades is that the detailed work of specifying the destination percentages is done once in the species, then quickly applied to many thins. Because mill gate prices, harvest costs, and transport costs are specified by species on the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/263_Log Grades or Crop Grades.htm" target="_blank">Log Grades or Crop Grades</a> page, you must use the log grade system if doing economic modelling (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/138_Configure Other Options.htm" target="_blank">Configure Other Options</a>).</p>
<p><b><i>Manual</i></b></p>
<p>The destination percentages for each thinned pool (stems, branch, bark or leaves) must add to less than or equal to 100%. If they add to less than 100% then the material without a destination remains on the plot, in the forest.</p>
<p>If the thin affects all the stems (the affected portion is 100% and the stem destination percentages add to 100%) then the thin must clear all of the other tree pools as well to be physically realistic (because leaves die without stems or branches).</p>
<p>It is possible to retain root material on site to simulate a coppicing effect.</p>
<p><b>Example</b>. Suppose the affected portion is 70%. Let the bark destination percentages be 20 to the bark litter, 10 to biofuel, 30 to paper and pulp, and 5 to mill residue Ś for a total bark destination percentage of 65. Thus 35% of the bark stays on the trees in the portion of the forest affected by the thin. Then, of all the bark on the plot, in this thin 70% * 20% = 14% goes to bark litter, 7% becomes biofuel, 21% becomes paper and pulp, 3.5% becomes mill residue, and the rest stays on the remaining trees.</p>
<p><b>Clearing Thin</b></p>
<p>For a thin to clear the forest of trees, the affected portion must be 100% and the destination percentages for each pool must add to 100%.</p>

<p>Specify the relative allocations of new growth to the tree components not affected by a a thin in the period immediately after a thin.</p>
<p><b>Details</b></p>
<p>Tree growth can be modelled for modified behaviour for a period after a thin, due to the response of the trees to the thin. </p>
<p>FullCAM models the post-growth differences using relative allocation multipliers. Each multiplier multiplies the relative allocation that would otherwise occur, for the whole length of the post-thin period. No extra growth occurs, just the allocation of any growth to the various components can be changed.</p>
<p>The modified behaviour during a post-thin period will be superceded by the parameters in any sucsequent thinning event.</p>

<p><b>Harvest</b></p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/137_Event Window.htm" target="_blank">Event Window</a> : <i>Harvest</i> panel]</p>
<p>Enter the inputs specific to a harvest event.</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The forest counterpart of a harvest is a <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/140_Thin.htm" target="_blank">Thin</a> event</p>
<p>A harvest is the only means of forming agricultural products, apart from grazing - see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/196_Grazing Change.htm" target="_blank">Grazing Change</a> events, and can take some of the crop offsite. See the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/47_Product Properties.htm" target="_blank">Product Properties</a> of each species.</p>
<p>GBF = Grains, buds, and fruit.</p>
<p><b>Affected Portion</b></p>
<p>The affected portion is the fraction of the agricultural system in which the harvest takes place. It is typically the fraction of the plot area that is harvested.</p>
<p><b>Destination Percentages in the Affected Portion</b></p>
<p>These destination percentages are applied to the portion of the agricultural system that is affected by the harvest.</p>
<p>The destination percentages of litter (GBF litter, stalk litter, and leaf litter) apply to all species whose material is present in the litter.</p>
<p><b><i>Crop Grades</i></b></p>
<p>Specify the percentages of full crop grade harvests, which are specified in turn for the species on the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/263_Log Grades or Crop Grades.htm" target="_blank">Log Grades or Crop Grades</a> page.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<p>specifying 50% of grade 1 means applying a Grade 1 thin  at 50% intensity.

<br/>specifying 100% of grade 3 and 0% for the other grades applies a grade 3 thinning.</p>
<p>You can mix and match, so long as the crop grade percentages do not exceed 100%.</p>
<p>The <i>Extra Percentages to Debris</i> are for moving material from the plants to the debris independently of (and in addition to) the crop grade movements. Especially useful for management operations like pruning. The total plant material moved to the debris is equal to the amounts specified by the crop grades, plus the extra movements specified here. The extra amount moved to the debris (above and beyond that specified by the crop grades) is equal to or less than the extra amount specified here (depending on whether or not the specified material is available after the crop grades).</p>
<p>Check the <i>Clear all remaining crop mass to debris</i> box for this to become a clearing harvest (all crop material not specified by the crop grades is thrown into the debris).</p>
<p>Click <i>Show Destinations Percentages...</i> to see all the crop grades for the species, and the affect of the specified crop grade percentages. You can see the destination percentages for the affected agricultural system, which are equivalent ot the the manual percentage changes (see next).</p>
<p>The advantage of the crop grades is that the detailed work of specifying the destination percentages is done once in the species, then quickly applied to many harvests, Because crop prices, harvest costs, and transport costs are specified by species on the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/263_Log Grades or Crop Grades.htm" target="_blank">Log Grades or Crop Grades</a> page, you must use the crop grade system if doing economic modelling (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/138_Configure Other Options.htm" target="_blank">Configure Other Options</a>).</p>
<p><b><i>Manual</i></b></p>
<p>The destination percentages for each harvested pool (GBF, stalks, leaves, coarse roots) must add to less than or equal to 100%. If they add to less than 100% then the material without a destination remains on the plot, in the agricultural system.</p>
<p>If the harvest affects all the stalks (the affected portion is 100% and the stalk destination percentages add to 100%) then the harvest must clear all of the other crop pools as well to be physically realistic (because leaves die without stalks).</p>
<p>It is possible to retain root material on site to simulate a coppicing effect.</p>
<p><b>Example 1</b>. The portion of the agricultural system that is affected by harvesting is 70%. The leaf destinations are 0% to biofuel, 40% to leaf products, 30% to hay, straw and silage, and 20% to litter — for a total bark destination fraction of 90% (10% of the leaves stays on the crops in the portion of the agricultural system affected by harvesting). Then, of all the leaves on the plot, in this harvest 70% * 40% = 28% goes to leaf products, 21% becomes hay, straw or silage, 14% becomes leaf litter, and the rest stays on the remaining crop plants.</p>
<p><b>Example 2</b>. Suppose there is a harvest of an apple orchard in which all of the orchard is harvested, 10% of the removed apple mass is left on the plot, 60% is sent to the supermarket (as a GBF product), and the rest is fed to pigs (thus qualifying as “hay, straw or silage”). Then the affected portion of the agricultural system is 100%, the destination percentage of GBF to GBF products is 60, the destination percentage to hay, straw, and silage is 30, and the destination percentage to litter is 10.</p>
<p><b>Clearing Harvest</b></p>
<p>For a harvest to be clearing and clear the agricultural system of its crop, the affected portion must be 100% and the destination percentages for each pool must sum to 100%.</p>
<p><b>Volatisation Percentages of Nitrogen</b></p>
<p>These are the percentages of the nitrogen from the material going to the products that goes to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that 20% of the leaves in the crop go to leaf products. Then 20% of the nitrogen in the leaves would also go to the leaf products — except that some of that nitrogen is volatised (moves to the atmosphere). Suppose that you specify the volatisation percentage of nitrogen going to leaf products as 40. Then 20% * 40% = 8% of the nitrogen in the leaves of the crop moves to the atmosphere during a harvest and 20% * 60% = 12% of the nitrogen in the leaves of the crop moves to the leaf products during a harvest.</p>

<p><b>Thin or Harvest : Plant Removal and Replacement</b></p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/137_Event Window.htm" target="_blank">Event Window</a> : <i>Thin</i> panel : <i>Tree/Plant removal and replacement</i> section]</p>
<p>Specify how the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/140_Thin.htm" target="_blank">Thin</a> or <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/153_Harvest.htm" target="_blank">Harvest</a> affects the average age of the plants.</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<table><tr><td>Thins</td><td width="5"></td><td><i>Plants</i> are trees; the <i>event</i> is a thin</td></tr>
<tr><td>Harvests</td><td width="5"></td><td><i>Plants</i> are crop plants; the <i>event</i> is a harvest</td></tr></table>
<p>The only effect of this section is to specify how the average age of the plants changes due to the event. By specifying the average age of the plants that are removed from the plot, and whether or not new plants spring up to replace them, you can control the change in the average age of the plants.</p>
<p>This is only of interest if you are using the average age of the plants to determine relative allocations or growth (see the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/42_Growth Properties.htm" target="_blank">Growth Properties</a> windows), in which case you can control how the event moves the plants along their growth curves.</p>
<p>These settings are only relevant and enabled for thinnings that leave some stems or stalks (if the fraction of plants removed is less than 100%).</p>
<p><b>Default Setting</b></p>
<p>Most people will want the default setting:</p>
<p>1.0 in the top box

<br/>0.0 in the middle

<br/>0.0 in the bottom box,

<br/>Do not check the <i>Replace removed plants</i> box.</p>
<p>Under this setting:</p>
<ul><li>The average age of the removed plants is equal to the average age of the existing plants</li>
<li>The average age of the plants on the plot is not changed by the event</li>
<li>No new plants grow to replace the removed plants.</li></ul>
<p><b>Removal-Age Formula</b></p>
<p>Specify the average age (in years) of the plants that are removed by the event by specifying the three coefficients in a formula:</p>
<ol><li>The multiplier for the current average age of the plants (<i>A</i>)</li>
<li>The multiplier for the age of the oldest plants in the forest or crop (<i>B</i>)</li>
<li>An additive constant, in years. (<i>C</i>)</li></ol>
<p>The average age of the removed plants is</p>
<p><blockquote><i>A</i> * (average age of plants)  +  <i>B</i> * (age of oldest plants)  + <i>C</i>.</blockquote></p>
<p>If this average age is less than zero it is changed to zero; if it is greater than the age of the oldest plants it is changed to the age of the oldest plants.</p>
<p><b>Example 1</b>. If <i>A</i> = 0, <i>B</i> = 0, <i>C</i> = 15 then the average age of the removed plants is 15 years. So if the average age of the plants at the time of the event was 10 years, then the average age of the removed plants would be 15 years. So if 50% of the stems or stalks were removed and there was no replacement, then the average age of the plants after the event would be 5 years.</p>
<p><b>Example 2</b>. If <i>A</i> = 1.2, <i>B</i> = 0, <i>C</i> = –0.5 then the average age of the removed plants is 20% greater than the average age of plants (before the event) less half a year. So if the average age of the plants at the time of the event was 10 years, then the average age of the removed plants would be 1.2 * 10 – 0.5 = 11.5 years. So if 50% of the stems or stalks were removed without replacement then the average age of the plants after the event would be 8.5 years.</p>
<p>The average age of the removed plants is only used to calculate the average age of the remaining plants. It is your responsibility to specify the average age of the removed plants sensibly. If the average age of the plants after the event is greater than the age of the oldest plants then it is changed to the age of the oldest plants.</p>
<p>The age of the oldest plants is not affected by the event — it is only altered by planting or clearing events, and the passage of time.</p>
<p><b>Replacement</b></p>
<p>Check the <i>Replace removed plants with new plants (of age 0)</i> box if you want new plants to grow spontaneously, starting from age zero at the time of the event and without a planting event, in the spaces left behind by the removed plants.</p>
<p>Checking this box is appropriate for a native forest, but usually not appropriate for a plantation forest. If the thinned trees were intermingled through the forest, the non-thinned trees may bulk up to fill the space previously occupied by the thinned trees (so consider a forest treatment event that lowers the effective age of the trees). If the thinned trees all come from the same portion of the plot and that portion is completely cleared by the thin, then it would be better to model the forest with an <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/72_Estate Simulation.htm" target="_blank">Estate Simulation</a>, using multiple plot files to reflect the different management, rather than as a single plot file.</p>
<p><b>Coppices</b></p>
<p>If there are no stems or stalks left after the event yet the event is not a clearing event (so the affected portion is 100% but the sum of the destination percentages for at least one pool is less than 100%), then the average age of the plants is not changed by the event (thus, you can create coppices).</p>

        <h2 class="page-title">Forest Fire</h2>
        <html><head><title>Forest Fire</title>
<!--#include file="./incs/header.inc.htm"-->
<p><b>Forest Fire</b></p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/137_Event Window.htm" target="_blank">Event Window</a> : <i>Forest Fire</i> panel]</p>
<p>Enter the inputs specific to a forest fire event.</p>
<p><b>Affected Portion</b></p>
<p>The affected portion is the fraction of the forest area that is burnt or partly burnt.</p>
<p><b>Age Adjustment</b></p>
<p>The Age Adjustment allows for some additional growth of woody biomass post-disturbance. This is achieved by effectively re-calculating the stand age applied in the TYF such that it is less than the actual stand age. The effective stand age applied in the TYF post Age Adjustment is calculated from the biomass removed in the disturbance event. This calculation is based on the TYF and its relationship between age and above-ground biomass. The effective stand age is assumed to decline backwards along the TYF such that the more biomass removed, the younger the stand is assumed to be when growth resumes post-disturbance.  Hence, the impact of the Age Adjustment is dependent on both the amount of biomass removed and also the stand age at the time of disturbance. For relatively young stands, this will stimulate growth when the effective stand age is moved back to be closer to the age of maximum biomass increments (G years). However for mature stands, the Age Adjustment has relatively little impact on growth.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the effective stand age used in the TYF may be different to the actual stand age. Both of these stand ages are available as outputs of the model.</p>
<p><b>Destination Percentages in the Affected Portion</b></p>
<p>These destination percentages are applied to the portion of the forest that is affected by the fire.</p>
<p>The tree material that is affected by the fire can be transferred to the atmosphere, to the Standing Dead pool, or to the debris pool. Standing dead material created in an earlier event can be similarly transferred to the atmosphere or to debris. Debris and mulch material can be transferred to the atmosphere or to inert soil (as charcoal). Where the sum of the destination percentages for a single pool do not sum to 100%, the remainder is taken to stay in its original pool.</p>
<p>Material transferred from one pool to another as a result of the fire event will not be further affected by the fire event. For example, a single forest fire event can move stems to debris, but not further to inert soil.</p>
<p><b>Years to Regrow Post-Fire</b></p>
<p>If a forest fire event is applied to a forest layer where trees are planted and growing (ie: not thinned), they will recover to their previous level of growth within the time period specified. This behavior should only be used to model fires that are not stand-replacing. If a stand-replacing fire is being modelled, it should be accompanied by other events for the thinning and re-planting of trees.</p>
<p><b>Using Fire Events to Model Land Clearing</b></p>
<p>Forest fire events can be applied following a <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/140_Thin.htm" target="_blank">thinning</a> (forest removal) event to remove the debris created during thinning, consistent with the concept of a <i>conversion burn</i>. When creating a <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/274_New Regime.htm" target="_blank">New Regime</a> for tree species, such fire events will be created alongside thinning events.</p>

<p><b>Agricultural Fire</b></p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/137_Event Window.htm" target="_blank">Event Window</a> : <i>Agricultural Fire</i> panel]</p>
<p>Enter the inputs specific to a agricultural fire event.</p>
<p><b>Affected Portion</b></p>
<p>The affected portion is the fraction of the agricultural system in which the fire takes place. It is typically the fraction of the plot area that is burnt or partly burnt.</p>
<p><b>Destination Percentages in the Affected Portion</b></p>
<p>These destination percentages are applied to the portion of the agricultural system that is affected by the fire.</p>
<p>The crop material that is affected by the fire either moves to the atmosphere, moves to the debris, or remains where it is. The debris and mulch material either moves to the atmosphere, to the inert soil (as charcoal), or remains where it is. The sum of the two destination percentages for a single pool must be less than or equal to 100%.</p>
<p>Material is moved from the crop to the debris after the amounts of debris that move have been calculated. Crop material cannot go immediately to the inert soil as a result of a fire.</p>
<p><b>Example</b>. The portion of the agricultural system that is affected by the fire is 90%. The GBF destination percentages are 80 to the atmosphere and 10 to the debris — for a total stem destination percentage of 90. Then, of all the GBF material on the plot, in this fire 90% * 80% = 72% goes to the atmosphere, 90% * 10% = 9% becomes GBF litter, and the remaining (100% – 90%) + 90% * (100% – 90%) = 19% stays where it was.</p>
<p>Typically very little if any of the deep minerals will be lost to the atmosphere, and only a small portion or none of the shallow minerals.</p>
<p><b>Clearing Fire</b></p>
<p>For a fire to clear the agricultural system entirely of crop, the affected portion must be 100% and the destination percentages for each pool (the sum of the destination percentages to the atmosphere and to the debris) must sum to 100%.</p>

<p>Enter the grazing inputs that apply from this event until the next grazing event. A plot simulation always starts with grazing switched off. Grazing occurs to plants after production and turnover; it does not affect either production or turnover.</p>
<p><b>New Grazing Levels</b></p>
<p>Specify the new level of grazing, to apply from this event until the next grazing event.</p>
<p>In any aboveground plant or litter pool, if the amount of specified grazing exceeds the amount of material in the pool then the grazing is reduced such that all of that pool is eaten away (that is, the pool mass is prevented from going negative).</p>
<p>Like all inputs in FullCAM, the grazing inputs apply to the crop or litter as it is at the beginning of each processing time period (at the later of the beginning of the last step or after the last event).</p>
<p><b>New Root Slough</b></p>
<p>Root sloughing keeps the root mass in proportion to the aboveground plant mass.</p>
<p>Example: Suppose grazers remove 90% of the aboveground plant mass . If root sloughing is on, the plant will turn over 90% of its roots to debris — except that if the maximum root slough percentage is less than 90%, the percentage of roots sloughed off is the maximum root slough percentage. But if root sloughing is off, then the plants will keep all their roots regardless of how fiercely their aboveground mass is grazed.</p>
<p><b>New Fodder Destination Percentages</b></p>
<p><i>Fodder</i> is the plant material eaten by any grazing animals. The fodder destination percentages specify where the carbon and nitrogen in the fodder moves to after passing through the grazing animals.</p>
<p>Material gets to the DPM and RPM (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/114_RothC.htm" target="_blank">RothC</a>) via manure (typically around 30%) and urine; it gets to the mineral pool via urine; it gets to the atmosphere via urine, manure and enteric fermentation.</p>
<p>Typically all N from manure and urine goes into shallow ammonium.</p>
<p>The sum of the destination percentages for each of carbon and nitrogen is always 100%; the last destination percentage in each column (animal products) is calculated automatically for you.</p>

<p>A forest treatment can be applied to a forest whose growth is being determined by the tree yield formula <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/130_Tree Yield Formula.htm" target="_blank">Tree Yield Formula</a>. The treatment alters the growth characteristics of the trees onward from that point in time.</p>
<p>Each treatment has a Type 1 and a Type 2 effect as described in Snowden (2002). A Type 1 event occurs during the life of a rotation and has an effect for a specified period (generally to advance the rate of growth) in a way that would likely shorten overall rotation length. A Type 2 event is an increase in site productivity (possibly due to species change) over the entire rotation period.</p>
<p><b>Type 1: Age Advance</b></p>
<p>A type 1 treatment moves the forest back or forth along the growth-age curve determined by the tree yield formula, by advancing or retarding the adjusted age of the trees used in the formula. See <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/42_Growth Properties.htm" target="_blank">Growth Properties</a>.</p>
<p>The tree age used in the tree yield formula is advanced by the <i>Age advance due to treatment</i>, phased in steadily over the years in the <i>Advancement period</i> (which begins starting with the event).</p>
<p><b>Type 2: Tree Yields</b></p>
<p>When the tree yield formula is in use, the maximum aboveground biomass is equal to the maximum aboveground biomass entered in the <i>Site</i> window (<i>M</i> in the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/130_Tree Yield Formula.htm" target="_blank">Tree Yield Formula</a>) multiplied by the current tree yield multiplier (<i>y</i>).</p>
<p>Thus the “tree yield multiplier” multiplies the tree yield that would otherwise be computed by the tree yield formula (because the tree yield is proportional to the maximum aboveground biomass in the tree yield formula), and likewise multiplies the maximum aboveground forest biomass allowed on the site.</p>
<p>The tree yield multiplier always starts a simulation at 1.0, and only changes due to forest treatments. Each type 2 forest treatment replaces the previous treatment.</p>

<p>Enter the inputs specific to a chopper roller event.</p>
<p><b>Details</b></p>
<p>A chopper roller event is where machines run over post-harvest slash (residue) of a forest breaking up the coarse woody litter (coarse aboveground debris). This typically only occurs after thinning 100% of forest plantations, and its goal is to accelerate the breakdown of the coarse litter.</p>
<p>A chopper roller event can only occur in a forest when there are no trees.</p>
<p>In a chopper roller event in FullCAM:</p>
<ul><li>The specified percentages of material in the deadwood and bark pools are moved to the chopped wood pools.</li>
<li>The distinction between decomposable and resistant material is maintained: there is a decomposable chopped wood pool and a resistant chopped wood pool.</li></ul>
<p>The chopped wood pools have their own breakdown inputs, set in the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/45_Debris Properties.htm" target="_blank">Debris Properties</a> window for each tree species. The breakdown percentages of the chopped wood (that is, the percentages that breakdown per year) are typically higher than the breakdown percentages of the deadwood or bark pools.</p>

<p>There is no termite activity at the beginning of a simulation. Termite action begins with the first termite event. Turn off future termite activity again by setting all the inputs of a termite event to zero.</p>
<p>In FullCAM, termites only eat deadwood and coarse dead roots in forests. The eaten material goes immediately to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>A “percentage eaten by termites” is the percentage of the material in the pool at the beginning of each simulation step that does not break down during the step but that is eaten by termites. Material added to the debris during a step cannot be eaten by termites — so even with 100% termite percentages there may be a little coarse woody debris present at the end of each step.</p>

<p>Forest percentage change events with no valid choice are shown as a simulating event in the event list (so you can change their type), but are shown as not ready and have no effect on the simulation.</p>
<p><b>Equal to a Constant</b></p>
<p>This is the recommended way to adjust the forest percentage when using the default parameters available from downloaded data.  The forest percentage will be changed to the specified value and will not change until a subsequent forest change event occurs.</p>
<p>Note that the Forest Percentage Change does not automatically respond to events that plant or remove trees.  A forest percentage change event should always be created alongside another event that purports to change land management practices and/or influence the presence of a forest, consistent with the events created from <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/274_New Regime.htm" target="_blank">new regimes</a>.</p>
<p><b>Determined by the Tree Yield Formula</b></p>
<p>Under this option the forest percentage rises from 0% at planting to 100% at the age of maximum growth. This relies on the evidence that the age of maximum growth is at or near the age of canopy closure. The growth determined by the tree yield formula is not affected by the forest percentage, but the tree growth affects how much room is left for pasture between the trees.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Under this option, in simulation steps where the tree yield formula is not in use, the forest percentage is equal to the constant forest percentage entered in the initial conditions.</p>
<p><b>Determined by the Tree Age</b></p>
<p>It may be used with or without the tree yield formula.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Under this option, in simulation steps where the tree yield formula happens to not be in use, the forest percentage is equal to the constant forest percentage entered in the initial conditions. This is similar to the linking of canopy closure and age of maximum growth in the previous option but lets the user set the age of canopy closure manually.</p>

<p>This page lists the output windows. A check beside the name means that the output window will open after you run a simulation. At least one output window must exist - you cannot delete the last output window, but you can uncheck it.</p>
<p><b>Estate Outputs</b></p>
<p>You may obtain any non-timing FullCAM outputs in the output windows of an estate, because an estate consists of plot files with configurations that may vary, and these configurations are not necessarily known when you specify the estate outputs.</p>
<p>If an output is not possible for a plot that is simulated during an estate simulation due to the configuration settings, then the plot will not contribute, or will contribute zeroes, to that estate output. For example, if you choose to report forest products but these are not included in the plot files they will contribute zero to the estate outputs.</p>

<p>This window shows your selected outputs for the last simulation, either in a graph or a table.</p>
<p><b>Show Graph or Table, Choose Outputs</b></p>
<p>To show the outputs as a graph, press the <i>View As Graph</i> button (leftmost button in the toolbar in the Output window).</p>
<p>To show the outputs an a table of numbers, press the<i> View As Table</i> button (second from the left in the toolbar in the Output window).</p>
<p>To change which outputs are showing in the graph and table, press the <i>Choose Outputs</i> button (third from the left in the toolbar in the Output window).</p>
<p><b>Multiple Output Windows</b></p>
<p>You may have more than one output window for a given document (plot or estate). The outputs shown in each of the output windows can be unrelated, which allows you to look at several different aspects of the simulation simultaneously.</p>
<p><b>Output Descriptions</b></p>
<p>The <i>C mass</i> of X is the mass of carbon in X, that is, the mass of all the carbon atoms in X.</p>
<p>The <i>N mass</i> of X is the mass of nitrogen in X, that is, the mass of all the nitrogen atoms in X.</p>
<p><i>Whole</i> means the whole of the land under consideration. The “whole land” consists of the forest land and the agricultural land (one of which may be missing, depending on the configuration). The land under consideration is a plot in a plot simulation and an estate in an estate simulation.</p>
<p>The <i>complete</i> mass of some land (either whole, forest, or agricultural) is the mass on and due to that land. It includes the plants, debris, mulch (if modelled), soil, any products from the land, and any fossil fuels displaced by the burning or use of those products.</p>
<p>The <i>onsite</i> mass of some land (either whole, forest, or agricultural) is the mass on that land. It includes the plants, debris, mulch (if modelled), and soil.</p>
<p><i>Yield rates</i> are the combined rates of production and turnover, and are what is observed by simply measuring the plants periodically.</p>
<p><i>Emit</i> and <i>sequester</i> refer to emissions to the atmosphere and removal from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Any moves of material between pools comprise a net movement. In most cases a move is only possible in one direction, but moves involving the minerals pools can often be bi-directional.</p>
<p><b>Graph</b></p>
<p>A few points to note when using the graphing feature:</p>
<ul><li>Double-clicking on a graph item opens the graph settings window at the appropriate place. Single-clicking an item selects it, whereupon you can drag it around the window, or resize it by dragging on a handle. Shift-select to select multiple items. For example, make the graph bigger by single-clicking on it, then dragging the lower-right handle of the graph.</li>
<li>The content of the titles (graph, x-axis, and y-axis) can either be set automatically by FullCAM or entered manually. Double-click on the relevant title to open the graph settings window, and then choose either <i>Automatic</i> or <i>Manual</i>. If <i>Manual</i> is selected, type in the desired wording for the graph.</li>
<li>The axis scales (that is, the starting number, ending number, and where the tick marks occur) can either be set automatically by FullCAM or chosen manually. Double-click on the axis numbers to open the graph settings window at the appropriate place. Choose either <i>Automatic</i> or <i>Manual</i>, and if <i>Manual</i> type in the desired parameters.</li>
<li>The axis, line, and border widths are chosen in points. When they are shown on the screen they are rounded to the nearest whole number of pixels, but when printed they are shown as the correct number of points. Thus minor width changes will not show up on the screen, but will show up in a printed version.</li>
<li>Change the order of the outputs in the legend by switching to the table and dragging the output columns to the desired order.</li></ul>
<p><b>Graphing Using an External Program</b></p>
<p>The graph is very configurable and will satisfy most users. If you wish to create a graph in a different program:</p>
<ol type="1"><li>Save the data to a file using the <i>Save to File</i> button</li>
<li>Open the resulting <code>.csv</code> file in a graphing capable program.</li></ol>
<p>Alternatively: go to the table view, select the data you want (see selection shortcuts, below), copy it, then go to the other application and paste it as needed.</p>
<p><b>Table</b></p>
<p>Each row shows the state of the simulation at the END of the simulation step in the leftmost two columns. Thus, a table row shows the state of the plot AFTER the simulation step labelled in the row. For example, if there are 12 simulation steps per year then a row with <i>Step in Year</i> equal to “Feb” shows the state of the simulation at the END of February.</p>
<p>The first row of results always shows the initial conditions of the simulation. This row is coloured differently. Outputs that do not describe the initial conditions in a non-trivial manner do not have an entry in the initial conditions row.</p>
<p>Resize the columns by dragging the line separating the columns in the header (the line between the names of adjoining columns). FullCAM remembers your adjustments when it saves the plot.</p>
<p>Move a column by dragging its heading. FullCAM remembers the new arrangement when it saves the plot. FullCAM uses the order of the outputs in the table to make the graph legend (arrange the outputs in the graph legend by moving the table columns around).</p>
<p>Change the mass units of a column (typically from t/ha to kg or Mt per hectare) by selecting a cell in the column and using the mouse menu or the <i>Increase/Decrease Mass Unit</i> buttons in the toolbar.</p>
<p>Change the size of the window, and thus the area available to the table, by dragging a corner.</p>
<p>Select a column by double-clicking in the header or units rows of the column (or, for the first two columns, in the units row only), and select all the columns over to a second column by holding the shift key down while double-clicking the second column.</p>
<p>Select a row (except the second) by double-clicking in the first two columns of the row, and select all the rows down to a second row by holding the shift key down while double-clicking the second row.</p>
<p>Select all the data by pressing the <i>Select All Data</i> button. Select everything in the table by pressing the <i>Select All</i> button.</p>
<p>Make arbitrary selections of data and statistics by dragging the mouse. Drags that start in the heading rows are ignored (because they change the order of the columns instead), as are drags that start in the time columns.</p>
<p>When you have a selection, you can copy it and can paste it into other programs.</p>
<p><b>Notes on Specific Outputs</b></p>
<p>Production rates, turnover rates and yield rates are for the end of the step. Consider using more simulation steps per year. For example: if you have yearly steps, clear the forest in day 365 of a year (thus, the clearing occurs at noon on day 365 of the year), and plant trees on day 1 of the next year (the trees are planted at noon of day 1), then the reported production rate for the year (step) with the clearing will be zero because the rate is for the last part of the year — from noon until midnight on day 365, when there were no trees.</p>
<p>The conditional irrigation output is only accurate in simulation steps with no events (it is calculated from the conditional irrigation in the period from the latter of the beginning of the step or the last event in the step to the end of the step).</p>

<p><b>Estate Simulation</b></p>
<p>Some general aspects of simulating an estate in FullCAM.</p>
<p><b>Estates</b></p>
<p>An estate is an arbitrary collection of plots, where each plot is assigned an area.</p>
<p>A FullCAM plot is a model of what is happening at a particular point (a position with no area), and is limited to one tree species and one crop species and the interplay between them. An estate provides the mechanism for combining FullCAM plots into an area.</p>
<p>For example, to model a few hectares of plantation containing five species of trees, you would create:</p>
<ol><li>Five FullCAM plots, one for each of the tree species.</li>
<li>One FullCAM estate that defines the appropriate area for each plot, multiples plot results by plot areas and adds the resultant values together to give a single estate value for each output variable selected.</li></ol>
<p><b>Estate Documents</b></p>
<p>An estate document specifies a list of plots, where each plot also has:</p>
<ol><li>An area (in hectares)</li>
<li>A starting date for simulation of the plot.</li></ol>
<p>The estate represents the sum of the individual areas assigned to each plot. Each plot and its associated area is entered into the estate simulation on the basis of the starting time specified. See <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/167_Plots in the Estate.htm" target="_blank">Plots in the Estate</a>.</p>
<p><b>What Happens in an Estate Simulation</b></p>
<p>An estate simulation performs a plot simulation for each plot in the estate. The results (typically in t/ha) are multiplied by the plot area (so the results are, typically, in tonnes). The results for all plots are added together, to give the results for the entire estate.</p>
<ol><li>FullCAM creates a plot document in memory, called the <i>working plot</i>. The working plot is blank, but copies the timing and output information from the estate document.</li>
<li>FullCAM zeroes the outputs in the estate document.</li>
<li>For each plot in the estate FullCAM:

<ol><li>Reads the plot file into the working plot, except for the timing and output information.</li>
<li>Performs a plot simulation on the working plot.</li>
<li>Multiplies the working plot outputs by the area of the plot (for appropriate outputs) and add them to the outputs in the estate document.</li></ol></li>
<li>Scales the outputs in the estate document to allow for additive (such as carbon mass) or average (such as rainfall) outputs.</li>
<li>Destroys the working plot.</li></ol>

<p><b>Plot Files</b></p>
<p>[<i>Plot Files</i> page of the input window of an estate document]</p>
<p>Specify the plot files that are used by the estate.</p>
<p><b>Use</b></p>
<p>An estate is a collection of plots. Each plot in the estate has a plot file.</p>
<p>Details for a given plot file may be used by several plots in the estate. For example, details of a typical pine plantation plot file might be used for a 100 ha plot planted in 1982, a 20 ha plot planted in 1983, and so on. Therefore, the plot files are specified separately from the plots in the estate (which saves users having to edit numerous plot files).</p>
<p>All of the plot files in an estate must be in the same folder. Use the Choose Folder button to specify the folder. Thus, you can move plot files around on your computer as long as they remain within a single specified folder.</p>
<p>Plot files are listed by name. Those coloured light blue are not used in the estate as described, but are available for selection in the ‘Plots in the Estate...’ tab.</p>
<p>To add a new plot to the list of plot files, first ensure that the desired new plot file is located in the appropriate folder specified using the ‘Choose folder...’ button. Then press ‘New...’ select the desired plot from the dialog box and press ‘open...’ (or double-click the desired plot file). To replace a plot file currently within the plot files list select the plot file to be replaced, press ‘Edit...’, select the files list, select the new desired plot fie, and press ‘Open...’ (or double-click the desired plot file). This will update all plots in the estate that used the old plot file to use the new plot file (thereby substituting one plot file for another throughout the entire estate). Press the ‘Sort...’ button to arrange all plot files in the plot file list alphabetically. To delete a plot file from the list, select the file name and press the ‘Delete...’ button. The plot file will be removed from the estate but is not deleted from the folder containing the various plot files.</p>

<p><b>Plots in the Estate</b></p>
<p>[<i>Plots in the estate</i> of the input window of an estate document]</p>
<p>This page is for specifying the plots in an estate.</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>An estate is a collection of plots, each of which has an area and a starting time. For example, you may have plots for plantations of different species of trees on various sites, and your estate may be all of the plantations belonging to a certain timber grower.</p>
<p>The listing on the left shows all of the plots in the estate, one per line. Plots whose starting time is before the estate simulation starts are coloured light blue. Plots whose starting time is after the estate simulation ends are coloured dull orange.</p>
<p>Plots that are not ready for simulation are shown in red: edit them to correct missing or invalid data.</p>
<p>To add a plot to the estate use the ‘New...’ button. After pressing the ‘New...’, a dialog box opens in which a Start Time for the plot is specified by entering the Calender year and simulation step within that year when the plot was initiated. The Area of the plot is entered. The Plot File is selected from the drop-down list. Press ‘OK...’ to accept the clause and enter the Plot file, its area and start time into the estate.</p>
<p>To alter the Area or Start Time of a plot file within the estate, press the ‘Edit...’  button and alter the values that appear in the dialog box as required.</p>
<p>The ‘Clone...&amp;rdsquo button can be used to enter an exact copy of the plot file into the estate. This is useful when multiple plots of the same tree or crop type with different areas or start times need to be specified within the estate.</p>
<p>To remove a plot from the estate, select the plot and then press the ‘Delete...’ button.</p>
<p>The All Plots and Selected Plots boxes to the right of the list provide a summary of the number of plots and area of plots in the estate or selected.</p>
<p><b>The Estate Simulation</b></p>
<p>Simulate the estate by choosing <i>Run Simulation</i> from the <i>Simulate</i> menu (if that menu choice is greyed out then the estate is not ready — attend to anything marked in red).</p>
<p>Each plot in the list of plots is simulated in turn. The results for each plot, over the whole of the estate simulation period, are added together to form the estate results, which are reported as the estate outputs.</p>
<p>The estate timing is used to simulate every plot in the estate, overriding the plot timing in each plot. That is, the plot simulation will start at the time dictated by the time specified in the estate plot window. The alignment of plot and estate timings is very difficult if calendar (actual year instead of time since commencement) timing is used in plot files. It is recommended that plot files for use in estates be developed or converted to remove calendar dates and that FullCAM users specify time since commencement instead.</p>
<p>Each plot simulation within the estate simulation begins at the start year and start step of the plot, called the <i>start time</i> of the plot. There are three possibilities for the start time of the plot and estate simulation period. One of two types of timing can be applied to individual ‘Plots in the Estate’ - Plot Timing and Estate Timing. The timing option can be toggled between by selecting any number of plots in the ‘Plots in the Estate’ window, right-clicking on the selected plots and choosing either ‘Use Plot Timing’ or ‘Use Estate Timing’.</p>
<p>If Plot Timing is chosen there are three possibilities for the start time of the plot and estate simulation period:</p>
<ol><li>Plot start time is before the estate start time. The plot simulation begins at the start plot time and ends at the end of the estate simulation period, but the plot results only contribute to the estate totals during the estate simulation period.</li>
<li>Plot start time is after the estate start time but before the estate stop time. From the estate start time to the plot start time, the plot contributes the initial conditions of the plot to the estate total — that is, the plot is assumed to be frozen at its starting point for all of that time. The plot is simulated from its start time to the end time of the estate simulation period, during which the plot results contribute to the estate totals.</li>
<li>Plot start time is after the estate stop time. The start time of the plot is after the end time of the estate simulation period. During all of the estate simulation period, the plot contributes the starting conditions of the plot to the estate total — that is, the plot is assumed to be frozen at its starting point for all of the estate simulation period. The plot is not simulated during the estate simulation.</li></ol>
<p>If ‘Use Estate Timing’ is chosen then the plot start time will begin at the estate start time. However, unlike using Plot start time, the plot does not remain frozen at the starting point of the initial conditions. Instead normal plot dynamics will occur from the beginning of the estate simulation, and the ‘Start Year’ and ‘Start Step’ of the plot will determine when the event queue for the plot begins to simulate.</p>
<p>When the plot results are added to the estate totals, the plot results in units (usually tonnes) per hectare are multiplied by the plot area (in hectares) and then added to the corresponding estate total in units.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/72_Estate Simulation.htm" target="_blank">Estate Simulation</a>.</p>
<p><b>Times: Growth Time Series and Events</b></p>
<p>A single plot file can be used many times in an estate, and each of these plots may have a different start time. If any of the species time series (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/42_Growth Properties.htm" target="_blank">Growth Properties</a>) or events (such as planting or thinning) are specified in terms of calendar years then the plot file might become invalid (and thus not ready for simulation) for some plot start times. If this occurs, FullCAM will notify you and then abandon the estate simulation.</p>
<p>To avoid this possibility, in your plot files you should specify:</p>
<ul><li>The species time series using times since planting</li>
<li>Events in terms of time since the start of the simulation.</li></ul>
<p>Use species or event timing in terms of calendar years with caution, because they must make sense in terms of how the plot file is used in the estate simulation.</p>
<p><b>Example</b>. Suppose you have a plot file for a plantation forest, in which all the time series data (such as rainfall) and events (such as forest fires) are specified in terms of years since the start of the simulation. You then create an estate, simulated from 1940 to 2000, with three plots that use this same plot file:</p>
<p>1. 10 ha, starting in 1940

<br/>2. 20 ha, starting in 1950

<br/>3. 30 ha, starting in 1960.</p>
<p>The plot file will then be simulated in the estate three times, and each result will be the same, except displaced 10 years apart. Thus, the 1940 plot in 1970 will be identical to the 1950 plot in 1980 and the 1960 plot in 1990 (despite differing in size)..</p>
<p>Now suppose you add a forest fire to the plot file, but specify it as occurring in 1956 (a calendar year). Now when you run the estate, each of the three simulations will be different — in the 1940 plantation the forest fire in 1956 occurs in the 16th year of the plantation, in the 1950 plantation the forest fire in 1956 occurs in the 6th year of the plantation, in the 1960 plantation the forest fire in 1956 does not occur (remember, a plot contributes its starting conditions to each estate simulation step before the plot simulation starts, so the 1960 plot would show no effects from the 1956 fire).</p>

<p>[<a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/167_Plots in the Estate.htm" target="_blank">Plots in the Estate</a> : <i>New</i> or <i>Edit</i> button]</p>
<p>This window specifies the properties of one of the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/167_Plots in the Estate.htm" target="_blank">Plots in the Estate</a>.</p>
<p><b>Details</b></p>
<p>Simulation of the plot begins in the year and step of the start time specified here. For example, if a plot start year is set to 1985 and its start step to 6 (which would be June, if the estate timing was 12 steps per year), then the plot will be simulated starting with step 6 in 1985 of the estate simulation.</p>
<p>If the estate simulation starts before the plot simulation (the estate simulation start time is before the plots start time), then the plot contributes its initial conditions to the estate up until the plot simulation starts. For example, if the estate simulation is from 1980 (step 1) to 2000 (step 21) and a given plot starts in 1985 (step 6), then when the estate totals are calculated this plot will contribute its initial conditions for 1980 through step 5 of 1985. So if the plot has an initial debris carbon of 5 tC/ha, it will contribute 5 tC/ha to the estate’s debris carbon for each step from step 1 in 1980 through step 5 of 1985.</p>
<p>The <i>Step</i> of the start time cannot be greater than the steps-per-year in the estate timing. If the value violates this condition, then it appears in red, and the plot and the estate cannot be simulated (the plot in need of editing is shown in red in the list of plots in the <i>Plots in the Estate</i> page). If you change the estate timing, some plots in the estate may change their readiness.</p>
<p>The area is the size of the plot, in hectares (a hectare is an area equal to a square 100 meters by 100 meters, 1 hectare = 2.471 acres). Note that plot files do not have an area, and their masses are described in tonnes per hectare. In an estate simulation, a plot result expressed in tonnes per hectare is multiplied by the plot area to arrive at its contribution in tonnes to the estate.</p>
<p>The plot files are in the same order in the menu as they are in the <i>Plot Files</i> page of the estate document (where they can be sorted).</p>

        <html><head><title>Constituent Models In FullCAM</title>
<!--#include file="./incs/header.inc.htm"-->
<p><b>Constituent Models In FullCAM</b></p>
<p>This topic is about the constituent models (“submodels”) within FullCAM.</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>FullCAM was initially formed by integrating these models into a single cohesive model. FullCAM has since been expanded with capabilities that go well beyond just the constituent models.</p>
<p><b>FullCAM Consists of Constituent Models</b></p>
<p>FullCAM is a flexible and highly integrated system of the following models, each of which deals with particular aspects of the carbon cycling and greenhouse emissions accounting. The models can be used in various configurations, depending on your requirements.</p>
<ol><li><a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/77_CAMFor.htm" target="_blank">CAMFor</a> — <b>C</b>arbon <b>A</b>ccounting <b>M</b>odel for <b>For</b>ests models carbon cycling in a forest, including the trees, debris, soil, minerals, and wood products. Forest growth can be included as yield curves, empirical growth formula, or process modelling.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/78_CAMAg.htm" target="_blank">CAMAg</a> — <b>C</b>arbon <b>A</b>ccounting <b>M</b>odel for <b>Ag</b>riculture models carbon cycling in an agricultural system, including the crops, debris, soil, minerals, and agricultural products. Includes both cropping and grazing.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/114_RothC.htm" target="_blank">RothC</a> — <b>Roth</b>amsted Institute active soil <b>C</b>arbon Model models carbon cycling in the active soil.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Seamless Integration Into a Single Model</b></p>
<p>FullCAM always uses the constituent models appropriately, combining them as required into what appears as a single model of your specified plot.</p>
<p>CAMFor and CAMAg are framework models — they model multiple layers of a forest or an agricultural system respectively, and provide frameworks into which the other models can be embedded. GENDEC, RothC and 3PG are specialist models — they only simulate a single layer of a forest or agricultural system, but do so in more detail than CAMFor or CAMAg.</p>
<p>When you configure FullCAM, the constituent models are switched on and off as required by the configuration. The FullCAM <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/150_Configuration.htm" target="_blank">Configuration</a> page only allows you to enter configurations that makes physical sense.</p>
<p>For each of the constituent models, there is a configuration that allows the model to be run on its own — which is useful for verifying that FullCAM properly incorporates that model.</p>
<p><b>Types of Plot That Can Be Modelled</b></p>
<p>FullCAM allows you to run all sensible combinations of these models, to model any of the following:</p>
<ol><li>A forest</li>
<li>An agricultural system</li>
<li>A mixed forest and agricultural system</li>
<li>Trees only</li>
</ol>
<p>FullCAM can model one forest and one agricultural system simultaneously. Forests and agricultural systems both have debris and both have soil, so both GENDEC and RothC have both forest and agricultural versions. Forests have trees but agricultural systems do not. There are the following model-instances:</p>
<ol><li>CAMFor</li>
<li>CAMAg</li>
<li>Forest RothC</li>
<li>Agricultural RothC</li></ol>
<p>Forest RothC and agricultural RothC are identical except that the soil is always covered in forest RothC but may be either bare or covered in agricultural RothC.</p>

<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p>The name “CAMFor” comes from <i>C</i>arbon <i>A</i>ccounting <i>M</i>odel for <i>FOR</i>ests.</p>
<p>CAMFor is a model of a forest ecosystem — trees, debris, soil, minerals, and products. It models all movements of carbon between a forest system and the atmosphere.</p>
<p>CAMFor is a calculation tool, moving material around the forest system with simple inputs such as ratios, rate constants, and growth tables. It models processes such as growth, turnover, and decomposition that occur continuously. It models events, such as planting, thinning, and fires. It always tracks the carbon in each part of the system, and optionally tracks the nitrogen as well. It can operate at any time scale from yearly steps down to hourly steps.</p>
<p>CAMFor is a framework model. A tree growth model, a mulch model, and a soil model can be plugged into it to provide more detailed modelling of these layers. CAMFor does not model the soil itself; it requires a specialist soil model to model the soil for it.</p>
<p><b>Credits</b></p>
<p>The CAMFor model within FullCAM finds its conceptual foundations in a public domain FORTRAN program called <i>CO<sub>2</sub>Fix</i>, published in October 1990 by Frits Mohren, Kees Klein Goldewik, De Dorrchamp, Wageningen.</p>

<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/ssgs/RothC/RothC.php" target="_blank">Rothamsted Carbon Model</a> (RothC) model is a soil carbon model. RothC models the turnover of organic carbon in non-waterlogged soils, taking into account clay content, temperature, moisture content, plant and manure inputs, and plant cover. RothC tracks the amount of microbes and several soil pools containing active carbon. In FullCAM it has been extended to also track nitrogen by applying C:N ratios.</p>
<p><b>Active Soil Pools</b></p>
<p>RothC partitions the active soil into five components (soil pools):</p>
<table><tr><th>Component</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>DPM</td><td>decomposable plant matter</td></tr>
<tr><td>RPM </td><td>resistant plant matter</td></tr>
<tr><td>BIO-F</td><td>fast decomposing biomass</td></tr>
<tr><td>BIO-S</td><td>slow decomposing biomass</td></tr>
<tr><td>HUM</td><td>humified organic matter.</td></tr></table>
<p>The definitions of these soil pools can be found through the <a href="http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk" target="_blank">Rothamsted website</a> and manual.</p>
<p>The DPM pool tends to small and transient, decomposing easily, with material moving quickly from DPM to BIO-F, BIO-S, and HUM.</p>
<p>The RPM pool is sometimes called <i>particulate organic matter</i> (POM) elsewhere.</p>
<p>Typically the fraction of total soil carbon in the BIO-F and BIO-S pools is very small — these are small but very active pools of microbes. In practice it is often difficult to measure BIO-F and BIO-S.</p>
<p>The RothC model is always version 26.3 of RothC in the standard edition of FullCAM. In the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/48_Research Edition.htm" target="_blank">Research Edition</a> of FullCAM you have the option of using either version 26.3 or version 26.5 of RothC.</p>
<p><b>Inert Soil</b></p>
<p>The inert soil is all in the inert pool in FullCAM (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/203_Soil.htm" target="_blank">Soil</a>). The inert material is sometimes called "charcoal and charred plant material" (CHAR) elsewhere. In FullCAM the inert pool is outside of RothC — it is instead managed by <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/77_CAMFor.htm" target="_blank">CAMFor</a> or <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/78_CAMAg.htm" target="_blank">CAMAg</a> — even though the RothC model elsewhere has an inert pool. The inert pool is simply a reservoir of soil material that is very unlikely to move to any other pool in the foreseeable future. It mainly consists of charcoal or material that is physically encapsulated.</p>
<p><b>Credits</b></p>
<p>The RothC model within FullCAM implements the FORTRAN programs “ROTHC-26.3” and “ROTHC-26.5_32” by K.W. Coleman, D.S Jenkinson, L.C. Parry and J.H. Rayner. It draws on papers by Jenkinson and Coleman, amongst others.</p>
<p>The model was enhanced by the CSIRO in Adelaide (Jan Skjemstad) and the Department. Enhancements include the ability to use the historical weather time series rather than average weather, including the topsoil moisture deficit (TSMD) computations, and tracking nitrogen. Equilibrium and radiocarbon dating computations were omitted.</p>

<p>This window is for maintaining your FullCAM proxy settings.</p>
<p><b>Use System Default Proxy</b></p>
<p>This setting causes FullCAM to use the system default proxy which is specified in Control Panel -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Connections -&gt; LAN Settings.</p>
<p>If your LAN uses automatic configuration to set the proxy server, you must manually configure that proxy server in FullCAM.</p>
<p>This is the default setting for Proxy.</p>
<p><b>Use a Manually Configured Proxy</b></p>
<p>This option allows you to specify the address and port of the proxy that should be used. Type the proxy server name in the Address text box and the port number in the Port text box.</p>
<p><b>Do Not Use a Proxy</b></p>
<p>This option allows you to connect directly to the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/219_Departmental Server.htm" target="_blank">Departmental Server</a> overriding any system default proxy.</p>
<p>Please note that changes to your proxy settings will not take effect until the next time that you connect.</p>

<p>The research edition of FullCAM is intended only for professional researchers in carbon accounting and plant modelling. The research edition is available upon reasonable request.</p>
<p><b>Differences in Function</b></p>
<p>Functionally, the research edition differs from the standard edition in that:</p>
<ul><li>It includes the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/115_3PG.htm" target="_blank">3PG</a> tree growth model. (Both editions contain the 3PG-lite model for computing the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/188_Forest Productivity Index.htm" target="_blank">Forest Productivity Index (FPI)</a>.)</li>
<li>It can calculate the Forest Productivity Index from scratch (see <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/108_Configure Tree Production.htm" target="_blank">Configure Tree Production</a>)</li>
<li>It can do <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/55_Nitrogen Simulation.htm" target="_blank">Nitrogen Simulation</a> (other than just in the mulch, as part of <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/109_GENDEC.htm" target="_blank">GENDEC</a>).</li>
<li>It includes version 26.5 of <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/themes/custom/awe/fullcam/Help-FullCAM2024/114_RothC.htm" target="_blank">RothC</a>.</li></ul>
